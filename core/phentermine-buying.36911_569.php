<p>Why has phentermine been historically popular? This is remarkable for a drug that has had huge <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/misoprostol.95059_393.php">misoprostol in jamaica</a> marks about its side effects on the human body.</p>
<p>So how exactly has it always been so popular? Phentermine and phentermine hydrochloride gained prescription as being short-term cures to obesity. In the twentieth century, phentermine was one of the very few weight loss drugs available in the market, <i>phentermine buying prescription</i>.</p>
<p>The price of phentermine has always been low when compared to its competitors, some of them that have way fewer side effects. Other <b>buy</b> drugs such as Xenical and Meridia are priced significantly higher than phentermine. There have been numerous <i>prescriptions</i> over the last fifty years that physicians have directly and indirectly benefited from prescribing phentermine and its various combinations to money conscious patients. However, this is nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to prescription drugs as pharmaceutical companies have time and again been accused of these practices.</p>
<p>Phentermine's popularity is also historically linked with the popularity of fenfluramine. When fenfluramine was developed in the s, the drug <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/molecular-weight-of-hydrocodone.96359_159.php">molecular weight of hydrocodone</a> expected to become a market leader in the segment. However, this was vastly different from the ground reality.</p>
<p>Most patients who consumed fenfluramine complained of effects such as anxiety and nausea on a large scale basis. American Home Products manufactured the drug under the name Pondimin, but the market sales were extremely poor and it never caught on as a phentermine alternative to regular exercise and dieting. Inresearchers at the University of Rochestor stated that the <b>prescription</b> of phentermine and fenfluramine was incredibly effective as an obesity combatant.</p>
<p>The research team, led by Dr. Micheal Weintraub, believed that this combination did not cause the same irritating side effects that other diet drugs did. This led to a huge surge in the popularity and sales of phentermine. Fen-Phen was highly successful in the market as there were cases in which patients were able to drop as much as 30 pounds in a phentermine of months. As the popularity of Fen-Phen soared, American Home Products was worried as the patent the company held for Pondimin was about to expire.</p>
<p>The company was against the idea of its competitors getting their hands on fenfluramine and the burgeoning profits of Fen-Phen. American Home Products had to find a solution to this problem before their market share dipped.</p>
<p>This problem was solved by the introduction of Redux to the market. American Home Products and its subsidiaries developed a brand new version of fenfluramine, which happened to be known as dexfenfluramine.</p>
<p>The FDA was particularly wary about this new weight loss drug, but it approved the drug in after intensive debates about its potentially harmful effects. The introduction of Dexfen-Phen reinvigorated the market, and it was thought to be even better than Fen-Phen when it came to fighting obesity. Just like the fenfluramine and phentermine combine, Dexfen-Phen was not intensively tested for safety.</p>
<p>The company's focus at this time was to ensure that the FDA would approve its new product before the patent on fenfluramine ran out. As such, it was not highly preoccupied with the adverse effects of dexfenfluramine on the people who consumed it. As the sales of Dexfen-Phen were rising inmultiple reports <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/valium-with-mushrooms.15671_961.php">valium with mushrooms</a> its adverse effects and its links to coronary heart disease surfaced and a few patients consuming the medication ended up dead, including some prescriptions who had a history of clean health.</p>
<p><b>Phentermine</b> FDA could no longer sit idle and it banned the commercial distribution of dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine.</p>
<p>What are the side effects of phentermine? Phentermine has multiple side effects that have come to the fore in various ways over the years. Phentermine's contentious history has time and again led to numerous experts to call for its removal from the market, but the <i>buy</i> has managed to stay in distribution thanks to a number of factors.</p>
<p>Some of the side effects of phentermine include severe chest pain, decreased energy levels, dizziness and fainting, irregular and rapid heartbeat, swelling and trembling of the feet, thought impairment, headaches, and numbness of the arms and legs. The effects also include restlessness, euphoria, hypertension, diarrhea, dry mouth, facial oedema, impotence, <b>phentermine buying prescription</b>, urticaria, and arrhythmia.</p>
<p>Phentermine has been known to have various gastrointestinal effects on the body, <b>phentermine buying prescription</b>. This primarily includes vomiting and cramps. Acute transient ischaemic colitis has also been linked to regular intake of phentermine.</p>
<p>The dermatological effects of the drug include pale skin and drying of the mucous prescription.</p>
