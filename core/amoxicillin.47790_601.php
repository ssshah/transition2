<p>The last time, I went to sleep in the recliner watching a movie with my husband. He said after I slept for 3 hours, he finally woke me, amoxicillin mixed with oxycodone, oxycodone had to pull me out of the chair because I would immediately fall back into a deep sleep. I've read that there is a stage of adjustment before the body acclimates to this new drug, but I never had such adverse reactions when using Carisoprodol with Oxycodone.</p>
