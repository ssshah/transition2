<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. A prospective epidemiologic registry of acyclovir use during pregnancy was established in and completed in April  There were pregnancies followed in women exposed to systemic acyclovir during the first trimester of pregnancy resulting in outcomes. The occurrence rate of birth defects approximates that found in the general population. However, the small size of the registry is insufficient to evaluate the risk for less common defects or to permit reliable or definitive conclusions regarding the safety of acyclovir in pregnant women and their developing fetuses.</p>
<p>Acyclovir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Acyclovir concentrations have been documented in breast milk in 2 women following oral administration of acyclovir and ranged from 0. These concentrations would potentially expose the nursing infant to a dose of acyclovir up to 0. Acyclovir should be administered to a nursing mother with caution and only when indicated.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of oral formulations of acyclovir in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age have not been established. No overall differences in effectiveness for time to cessation of new lesion formation or time to healing were reported between geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The duration of pain after healing was longer in patients 65 and over. Nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were reported more frequently in elderly subjects.</p>
<p>Elderly patients are more likely to have reduced renal function and require dose reduction. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or CNS adverse events. The most frequent adverse events reported in a clinical trial for the prevention of recurrences with continuous administration of mg two mg capsules 2 times daily for 1 year in patients treated with acyclovir were nausea 4.</p>
<p>The control patients receiving intermittent treatment of recurrences with acyclovir for 1 year reported diarrhea 2. Herpes Zoster The most frequent adverse event reported during 3 clinical trials of treatment of herpes zoster shingles with mg of oral acyclovir 5 times daily for 7 to 10 days in patients was malaise  The placebo recipients reported malaise  Last year I missed the spots as they were on my back and suffered greatly for 2 to 3 months and I am still taking mg acyclovir per day.</p>
<p>Each time I stop the medication the fever returns for a couple of days followed by the first few spots. I am on my 5th lot of acyclovir, starting with mg per day, increasing to 2, per day and 2 weeks ago was prescribed mg per day for 21 days.</p>
<p>I have managed 10 days at this level but there are so many side effects, including kidney pain, so I have reduced to 3 tablets of mg each. I feel less "in a fog" and slightly better already but am afraid when I stop the shingles will return.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the side effects. Can you give me advice please? Shingles is a painful rash that is caused by the same virus varicella virus that causes the chickenpox.</p>
<p>Only people who were infected with the virus and got chickenpox can get shingles. Unfortunately, people with weakened immune systems, from other diseases like cancer or treatments like chemotherapy, are at much greater risk of developing shingles. Drugs like acyclovir Zovirax work to reduce the ability of the virus to multiply and spread in the body. Acyclovir has been shown to reduce the duration of infection and the severity of symptoms, but it relies on an individual's immune system to attack the virus.</p>
<p>The drug itself does not kill the virus and that is likely the reason you continue to have symptoms and relapses. It is possible that some of the painful effects you are experiencing are the result of complications of shingles. One of these complications is called postherpetic neuralgia, which is the painful, tingling, and stinging pain at the site of the initial rash.</p>
<p>There are medications that are used to help treat the pain associated with the nerve damage of shingles. These drugs include the anticonvulsants, such as Neurontin gabapentin , Lyrica pregabalin , and Tegretol carbamazepine and tricyclic antidepressants like Elavil amitriptyline.</p>
<p>Does acyclovir affect kidney disease? Acyclovir Zovirax is used to decrease pain and speed the healing of sores or blisters in people who have varicella chickenpox , herpes zoster shingles; a rash that can occur in people who have had chickenpox in the past , and first-time or repeat outbreaks of genital herpes a herpes virus infection that causes sores to form around the genitals and rectum from time to time.</p>
<p>Acyclovir is also sometimes used to prevent outbreaks of genital herpes in people who are infected with the virus. Acyclovir is in a class of antiviral medications called synthetic nucleoside analogues. Dosage adjustment is recommended when administering acyclovir to patients with renal impairment. Shereen Gharbia, PharmD Q: What is acyclovir used for? Acyclovir Zovirax is an antiviral medication that can be used in the treatment of the herpes virus, including genital herpes, cold sores, and shingles.</p>
<p>Acyclovir can also be used to help with the chicken pox virus. You can browse Drugs A-Z for a specific prescription or over-the-counter drug or look up drugs based on your specific condition.

Dosing should begin as early as possible after the start of an infection: Treatment of herpes zoster yields better results if initiated as soon as possible after the onset of the rash.</p>
<p>Treatment of chickenpox in immunocompetent patients should begin within 24 hours after the onset of the rash. Treatment should continue for five days. No specific data are available on the treatment of herpes zoster infections in immunocompetent children. For treatment of neonatal herpes virus infections, intravenous acyclovir is recommended. Dosage in the elderly: The possibility of renal impairment in the elderly must be considered and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly see Dosage in renal impairment below.</p>
<p>Adequate hydration of elderly patients taking high oral doses of aciclovir should be maintained. Dosage in renal impairment: Caution is advised when administering aciclovir to patients with impaired renal function. Adequate hydration should be maintained.</p>
<p>Administration Zovirax tablets are for oral administration and may be dispersed in a minimum of 50 ml of water or swallowed whole with a little water. Ensure that patients on high doses of aciclovir are adequately hydrated.</p>
<p>Aciclovir is eliminated by renal clearance, therefore the dose must be adjusted in patients with renal impairment see 4. Elderly patients are likely to have reduced renal function and therefore the need for dose adjustment must be considered in this group of patients. Both elderly patients and patients with renal impairment are at increased risk of developing neurological side effects and should be closely monitored for evidence of these effects.</p>
<p>In the reported cases, these reactions were generally reversible on discontinuation of treatment see 4. Prolonged or repeated courses of aciclovir in severely immune-compromised individuals may result in the selection of virus strains with reduced sensitivity, which may not respond to continued aciclovir treatment see section 5.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients receiving high doses of aciclovir. The risk of renal impairment is increased by use with other nephrotoxic drugs. The data currently available from clinical studies is not sufficient to conclude that treatment with aciclovir reduces the incidence of chickenpox-associated complications in immunocompetent patients.</p></p>

		<h2>Zovirax 800mg Tablets</h2>
		<p>I am concerned about the side effects. Probenecid and cimetidine increase the AUC of aciclovir by this mechanism, and reduce aciclovir renal clearance. For treatment of neonatal 800mg virus infections, intravenous acyclovir is recommended. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tumors between treated and control animals, nor did acyclovir shorten the latency of tumors, zovirax acyclovir 800mg. Cancer Res ; 33 6: Adverse events that have been acyclovir in association with overdosage zovirax agitation, coma, seizures, and lethargy. Does acyclovir cause hair loss? Acyclovir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
