		<p><p>Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. Call your doctor if you have any withdrawal symptoms when your dose is decreased or when you stop taking oxycodone. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
<p>Other uses for this medicine This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow? Before taking oxycodone, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to oxycodone, codeine in many pain relievers and cough medications , hydrocodone in Hycodan, in Lortab, in Vicoprofen, others ,dihydrocodeine in Synalgos-DC, others , any other medications, or any of the ingredients in oxycodone liquid, tablets, or capsules.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients. Be sure to mention any of the following: Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you not to take oxycodone. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a head injury,a tumor in your brain or nervous system, any condition causing increased pressure in your brain; hypothyroidism condition in which the thyroid gland produces less hormone than normal , hallucinations seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist ; delirium tremens severe withdrawal symptoms that may occur in people who drank large amounts of alcohol over time and have stopped drinking ; kyphoscoliosis curving of the spine that may cause breathing problems low blood pressure;Addison's disease condition in which the adrenal gland does not produce enough hormone , seizures; urethral stricture blockage of the tube that allows urine to leave the body , enlarged prostate a male reproductive gland , or heart, kidney,liver, or pancreas, or biliary tract disease.</p>
<p>If you become pregnant while taking oxycodone, call your doctor. Do not drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or participate in any other possibly dangerous activities until you know how this medication affects you.</p>
<p>When alcohol is taken with this medication, dangerous side effects can occur. To help avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up. What special dietary instructions should I follow? Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OxyContin, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone.</p>
<p>Prolonged use of OxyContin during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</p>
<p>Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Concomitant use with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics, azole-antifungal agents, and protease inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of OxyContin is achieved, and discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.</p>
<p>Monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of OxyContin until stable drug effects are achieved. Concomitant use of OxyContin with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. Monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur.</p>
<p>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of OxyContin with benzodiazepines or CNS depressants e. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use.</p>
<p>In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response.</p>
<p>If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when OxyContin is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs.</p>
<p>Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs. The use of OxyContin in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p>
<p>OxyContin-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OxyContin. Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients.</p>
<p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OxyContin and when OxyContin is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.</p>
<p>If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. OxyContin may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or after concurrent administration of certain CNS depressants drugs e.</p>
<p>Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OxyContin. In patients with circulatory shock, OxyContin may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.</p>
<p>Avoid the use of OxyContin in patients with circulatory shock. In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention e. Monitor those patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OxyContin. Opioids may obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as OxyContin, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OxyContin along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p>
<p>Abuse or misuse of OxyContin by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OxyContin. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug. Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended, and if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death.</p>
<p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OxyContin, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24—72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of OxyContin. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OxyContin are essential. Overestimating the OxyContin dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p>
<p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OxyContin, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. Prolonged use of OxyContin during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</p>
<p>Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.</p>
