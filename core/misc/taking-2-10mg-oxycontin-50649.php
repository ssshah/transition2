What I have been doing lately is breaking them in half, then taking the pill afterward. Is this a bad thing? I am currently taking 2 of the 5mg everyday and 1 10mg at night. I am thinking about taking half of a 5mg oxy before going out." />

		<p><p>Store at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and light. Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Oxycodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription. Always check your bottle to make sure you have received the correct pills same brand and type of medicine prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask the pharmacist if you have any questions about the medicine you receive at the pharmacy. After you have stopped using this medication, flush any unused pills down the toilet.</p>
<p>Throw away any unused liquid oxycodone that is older than 90 days. Prednisone has a tendency to cause fluid retention which can cause this to happen. Discuss this situation with your health care provider. Do not stop taking any of your medications without talking to your provider first. How long does oxycodone stay in your system? This answer depends on how much you take and for how long you have been taking the medication oxycodone. One tablet can last in your system up to 3 days, so if you are taking it on a daily basis, you are probably looking at about one month to become completely free of the medication.</p>
<p>Every person metabolizes medication at a different rate, so it is hard to say exactly when the medication will be out of your system. I'm having trouble understanding the differences between Oxycontin and Percocet. Oxycodone comes in a long-acting form that should only be take twice a day and should be taken whole, not crushed or chewed.</p>
<p>Percocet contains the short-acting form of oxycodone and is take up to three or four times daily. Your doctor should help you decide which is better for you, depending on your medical condition.</p>
<p>If you can't take acetaminophen, then you shouldn't use Percocet. Gerald Levy, RPh Q: Is Endocet the same as Percocet? Yes, Endocet and Percocet are both brands of oxycodone with acetaminophen. Under what circumstances should a person be prescribed Oxycontin by a doctor? I'm taking Oxycontin one dose 3 times a day and another 2 times a day for more than 5 years now. I also take tremedol and ambien every day. These drugs have not taken away my back pain.</p>
<p>We think they have done other things to my body. Oxycontin oxycodone extended-release is a prescription medication approved to treat moderate to severe pain. It is a strong narcotic painkiller that should not be used to treat mild or short-term pain. Oxycontin is meant to be used around the clock at scheduled times twice a day.</p>
<p>It is not approved for "as needed" use unscheduled use only when needed. Taking Oxycontin three times daily instead of the officially recommended twice daily dosage is a common off-label use of the drug.</p>
<p>It is not appropriate for treating pain after a surgery, unless your pain is expected to be moderate to severe and long-lasting. Some side effects with Oxycontin are potentially serious and should be reported immediately to your health care provider.</p>
<p>These include, but are not limited to: Oxycontin is a very effective pain medication that can be quite safe when used properly. However, it also has significant abuse potential. As with other narcotics, the body becomes physically dependent upon Oxycontin.</p>
<p>This is a predictable, physical response to long-term use of the narcotic. The body becomes accustomed to physical changes that Oxycontin causes, and stopping the drug will lead to withdrawal symptoms. It is important to understand that physical dependence on Oxycontin is not necessarily a sign of addiction, at least in the sense that most people use the term. Even people taking Oxycontin responsibly for a legitimate medical purpose will become physically dependent on the drug.</p>
<p>Friends and family can keep an eye out for signs of addiction, such as: Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details, and report any withdrawal reactions right away. When this medication is used for a long time, it may not work as well. Talk with your doctor if this medication stops working well.</p>
<p>Though it helps many people, this medication may sometimes cause addiction. Take this medication exactly as prescribed to lower the risk of addiction. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details. Tell your doctor if your pain persists or worsens. They may also have breathing difficulties leading to unconsciousness or even death and may need emergency treatment in hospital.</p>
<p>When seeking medical attention make sure that you take this leaflet and any remaining tablets with you to show to the doctor. If you forget to take your OxyContin tablets If you remember within 4 hours of the time your tablet was due, take your tablet straight away.</p>
<p>Take your next tablet at your normal time. If you are more than 4 hours late, please call your doctor or pharmacist for advice. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. You may see the remains of the tablets in your faeces. This should not affect how the tablets work. Reporting of side effects If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. That is what makes driving, working, and even walking dangerous while on an opiate such as oxy.</p>
<p>Your head feels good, you relax, and feel like you are "unstoppable". Which basically means you do not think rationally, take great risks, and engage in useless confrontation. Although the euphoria may make you forget about pain and be able to work more efficiently the slightest trigger could set you off in a place of high stress like that trust me.</p></p>
