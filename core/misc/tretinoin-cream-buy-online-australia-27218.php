		<p><p>Another indication that the cream is working is that the acne will first begin to get worse before it gradually starts to get better. However, if the irritation becomes severe or if no changes are observed in the acne within 8 to 12 weeks of use, it is recommended to consult a doctor for further advice.</p>
<p>Also, do not use any other topical cream on the area where you have applied Tretinoin for around one hour after application, otherwise it may not work or there might be severe skin irritation and allergy.</p>
<p>You should also avoid using the following products on the skin area where you apply the Tretinoin Cream: While using Tretinoin for treating acne, you can however, use water based creams to alleviate the irritation in the first few weeks of use.</p>
<p>If you are using the cream for treating dark spots, roughness and skin wrinkling, you can use oil based creams and lotions to reduce any dryness and irritation caused in the first few weeks. To apply Tretinoin to the affected area, wash your hands thoroughly before applying the medicated cream.</p>
<p>Carefully clean out the affected skin with a soapless or mild cleanser, and carefully pat it dry. Then use the fingertips to apply a small amount of the cream, about the size of a pea, to the affected area. The cream should be applied in a thin layer on the skin and must be applied regularly once each day before bedtime, or according to the directions of the doctor.</p>
<p>A cotton swab or gauze pad can be used to apply the liquid form of the cream to the affected area. To apply certain preparations, it is recommended to wait for around 20 to 30 minutes after cleaning the face, before the medication is applied to the skin. This medicine is for topical use only, and is not to be used on any burnt, damaged, sun-damaged and eczema affected part of the skin. Tretinoin for Acne The cream is also great for getting rid of that abhorrent and uninvited acne.</p>
<p>What is Tretinoin cream? Once scientists and medical researchers began to better understand how retinoids work how chemicals interact with our own biochemistry to produce a handful of specific and targeted results , the floodgates really opened up and Tretinoin began to take off. The beauty behind this specific solution is that it floods your skin with absolutely everything you need to look years younger without anything but this topical cream.</p>
<p>Because we are most definitely talking about a prescription drug here, and one that your general practitioner and a licensed dermatologist is going to have to sign off on before you can begin to take advantage of it, you have to understand and technology that there are a few side effects you may have to fight off.</p>
<p>Side effects may include: What about all those products at the drug store or beauty counter that sound a lot like it? Most of the products you will come across in beauty shops or most pharmacies are Retinols, Which are known as the weaker counterpart of Tretinoin. Although you may think that over the counter Retinols will save you money, it usually winds up costing you just as much, if not more, than the prescription version.</p>
<p>Sometimes you could even end up paying the same or more, for a less effective product. How to Use It You want to use it at bedtime. That helps ensure it has time to work its magic, and it limits your sun exposure while you have the product actively on your skin.</p>
<p>First things first, clean your skin. If your skin is covered with makeup or dirt and oil, the Retin-A will have a much harder time penetrating that layer and actually working on your skin.</p>
<p>Also, make sure your hands are clean. Then, spread the amount recommended by your doctor over your face. Wait minutes before putting any moisturizers on top of it, or before going to bed.</p>
<p>This helps it penetrate your skin, and not get diluted by another product, or rubbed off by your pillow.</p>
<p>How Fast Does It Work? It could well take around six weeks for the first sign of side effects to appear, for example: Having said that, many people may even notice results as early as 6 weeks or 2 months.</p>
<p>And 6 months is not the cut-off period for results to end. Your skin can continue to improve more and more as the years go by. Side Effects When you first begin using Retin A, you may experience the following side effects: After the first few weeks, these symptoms will clear up. Another thing, limit your sun exposure. If you have to be in the sun, wear sunscreen. Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun when using Retin-A.</p></p>
