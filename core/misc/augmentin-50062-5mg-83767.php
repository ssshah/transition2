		<p><p>Inform your doctor if your condition persists or worsens. Diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting may occur during the first few days as your body adjusts to the medication. Take with food to minimize stomach upset. If any of these effects persist or worsen, contact the doctor or pharmacist promptly. Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects.</p>
<p>Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. Tell your doctor immediately if any of these highly unlikely but very serious side effects occur: This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea due to a type of resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has stopped. Do not use anti- diarrhea products or narcotic pain medications if you have any of the following symptoms because these products may make them worse. Tell your doctor immediately if you develop: Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in oral thrush or a new vaginal yeast infection oral or vaginal fungal infection.</p>
<p>Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth, a change in vaginal discharge or other new symptoms. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. History of a severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction e. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactoid and severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy.</p>
<p>These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and in atopic individuals. This presentation of Co-amoxiclav is not suitable for use when there is a high risk that the presumptive pathogens have reduced susceptibility or resistance to beta-lactam agents that is not mediated by beta-lactamases susceptible to inhibition by clavulanic acid. This presentation should not be used to treat penicillin-resistant S.</p>
<p>Convulsions may occur in patients with impaired renal function or in those receiving high doses see section 4. Concomitant use of allopurinol during treatment with amoxicillin can increase the likelihood of allergic skin reactions. Prolonged use may occasionally result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.</p>
<p>The occurrence at the treatment initiation of a feverish generalised erythema associated with pustula may be a symptom of acute generalised exanthemous pustulosis AGEP see Section 4. This reaction requires Co-amoxiclav discontinuation and contra-indicates any subsequent administration of amoxicillin. Hepatic events have been reported predominantly in males and elderly patients and may be associated with prolonged treatment.</p>
<p>These events have been very rarely reported in children. In all populations, signs and symptoms usually occur during or shortly after treatment but in some cases may not become apparent until several weeks after treatment has ceased. These are usually reversible. Hepatic events may be severe and, in extremely rare circumstances, deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Tooth discoloration brown, yellow, or gray staining has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases. Coadministration of probenecid is not recommended. Oral Anticoagulants Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time increased international normalized ratio [INR] has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.</p>
<p>Allopurinol The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.</p>
<p>Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted. Before initiating therapy with AUGMENTIN, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens.</p>
<p>Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C.</p>
<p>Hypertoxinproducing strains of C. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Augmentin is not suitable for intramuscular administration. Children aged less than 3 months should be administered Augmentin by infusion only. Treatment with Augmentin may be initiated by the use of an intravenous preparation and completed with an appropriate oral presentation as considered appropriate for the individual patient.</p>
<p>For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6. History of a severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction e. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactoid and severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and in atopic individuals.</p>
<p>This presentation of Augmentin may not be suitable for use when there is a high risk that the presumptive pathogens have resistance to beta-lactam agents that is not mediated by beta-lactamases susceptible to inhibition by clavulanic acid.</p>

		<h2>Augmentin 500/62 5Mg – 210863</h2>
