		<p><p>I called my primary care who is my diabetic coach and she says not to worry the numbers will come down. I am very anxious about this all. Does the sugar rise right away and can I bring the numbers down with high protein and low carbs and increased insulin? My advice, though, is to have the injection, check your blood glucose levels frequently, and if you start to see them climb which they likely will , call your doctor for guidance on adjusting your medication.</p>
<p>Treat this like you would treat a sick day: Be firm and persistent with your doctor about this, but first, wait and see how the steroid affects you. I am not sure this will effect my diabetes. So the next step is injections. I am told this presurge will be in a hospital.</p>
<p>I guess like a uperdurial. I am taking Janumet and Levimir insulin, 42 twice a day. My sugar is in control now. Thank you, acampbell Hi Paulette, If your back injection contains a steroid and it very likely will , expect your blood glucose levels to increase for about 2—3 weeks afterwards.</p>
<p>Check your blood glucose several times a day during this time, and if you see that your glucose levels are rising, call your doctor. You may need to take a meal-time fast-acting insulin, like Humalog, NovoLog, or Apidra, temporarily during this time to help lower your blood glucose. Kathy G Hello, I had a blood test a week ago , and today my family doctor had call and said that I was a diabete.</p>
<p>My A1-c was  He thought that it could be from the prednisone that I have taken for years 5mg every other day. I have been in a lot of pain. So do you think this could cause my blood glucose to be so high?</p>
<p>He wants me too come back next week. If I stop the shots and come off of prednisone well it come down? How long do you think it will take? I just started on Arava last week. My thoughts are that your A1C of  Ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetes educator or a diabetes program in your community. I have had multiple problems. Bone fragment in my spine. I am having the steroid shots. I try to make sure my pre. My spike seems to come about 4 to 5 hours after the injections.</p>
<p>Use a titrated dose. In between my regular doses of insulin. This seem to keep me more level. Of my regular dose And recheck. Of my regular dose again. This seems to bring me down from the high range. It dosesnt seem to last more than days. I have bursitus and archilles tendinitis.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a steroid injection into my heel. Pain seems a little better. My BSL was fine for a few hours but when I checked it going to sleep it was 22!!</p>
<p>I took Humalog and stayed awake a few hrs and rechecked BSL before sleeping — was 18!! Took more humalog and set alarm to wake me 3 hrs later — only down to  More Humalog and took a mg Metformin my usual daily dose.</p>
<p>Was wondering if it is time to increase my Lantus dose and if so to how much? Was thinking 30units BD??? After reading above posts I have figured this is going to take a few weeks to settle down. Am I doing the right thing so far regarding altering Lantus and giving more Humolog??</p>
<p>Or should I contact my GP? Thanks Vicki acampbell Hi Vicki, As you are finding out, steroid injections can cause a significant increase in blood glucose levels and a need for higher insulin doses. Talk to your GP about adjusting your Humalog dosing during this time and check your blood glucose at least four times per day, before meals and at bedtime. The effect of the steroid usually lasts about two to three weeks. Initially you will need higher doses of Humalog to get the blood glucose levels down, but gradually these doses will go down as the steroid gets out of your system.</p>
<p>Checking three hours after the additional Humalog is the right thing to do. If you find that the doses are not bringing your blood glucose levels down enough call your GP to see if another adjustment is needed. Helena Been a juvenile diabetic since age  On Humalog and Humulin insulins two times daily. Humalog 12 units and Humulin 10 units. Was given shot of cortisone on right hip 29 April.</p>
<p>Am also practicing Bikram Hot Yoga 5 times a week. Noticed that 2 weeks after the cortisone shot in the muscle my blood sugars went drastically low. On Wed I got confused as driving and when traffic light red stopped and decided not to move when came green in spite of cars honking. Also realized after several major sugeries each time upset sugars DROP drastically.</p>
<p>I know yoga works every muscle down to the cellular level and so I will give up driving until 1 month later. Forgot to mention given cortisone on hip on account of bursitis. Rose Lots of interesting information. These high numbers people mention, , , etc. I think American numbers would be divided by 18??? Has anyone out there taken this amount… if so what were results on BS. I am Type 1 diabetic. A1C values are written as a percentage in the US, such as 7.</p>
<p>Plan on checking your blood glucose levels at least several times a day, and make sure you have a plan for how you might increase your insulin should you see that your glucose levels are rising. It was only on 26 May, almost 1 month after the shot was given that I was once again able to recognize that my blood sugar was dropping.</p>
<p>Also, when I was my regular doc about this she agreed that yes, 2 weeks later it can drop. Yet when I went to see her one week later to get her to fill out forms from motor vehicles with regards to my ability to drive she told me a different story.</p>

<p>It is ruining people's lives. Dana Burton We need to run pain clinics out of our cities and states!!!! These are the sources of these horrible life destroyers that are called oxycontin. Anonymous My daughter got hooked on oxy by her former boyfriend and is now taking suboxen to try and break the addiction. We are devastated that this could happen to our little girl and can only hope she is strong enough to beat this addiction. Noerper Ezell Harris I have added you to my recommended websites.</p>
<p>Please visit my website to fight the OxyContin Addiction that has grip our nation: The main purpose of www. Pharmaceutical Industry in cahoots with the federal government.

<p>Ron Howard I lost my beautiful daughter Brandi on October 9,  Thankfully, in my case, I was headed to a course full of pelvic health practitioners, and I begged one of them to treat my tailbone on the first day. The truth is, my story is not a totally uncommon one. I was lucky, because I know about tailbone pain…I was able to get it treated and I got better very quickly. So, where is the tailbone? The coccyx tailbone refers to the fused bones at the very end of the spine.</p>
<p>These fused segments attach to the sacrum. To feel your coccyx, slide your fingers down from the sacrum between each cheek of your bottom. You will feel a very small boney structure, and can often feel the tip of the coccyx which will be very close to the anus! I can't believe I've never heard of this, so was shocked that a google search turned up this board with comments from so many with nearly identical pains.</p>
<p>I will be calling my podiatrist tomorrow. There has to be an answer out there. Thank you to all who have shared their experiences so I don't feel completely alone.</p>

The pain was sharp and sudden and lasted about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>This morning I woke up and had 3 bouts of the same pain within about 5 mins I mainly wear flat shoes and have a sedentary job.

Russia, backed by China, hasvetoed three resolutions since October that would havecondemned Assad's government and threatened it with sanctions.</p>
<p>Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to accept thoseconditions, and the impasse resulted in the government shutdown.

I think the real question, is how the heck he ever qualified for these jobs in the first place. The long jump for the future? Forget it, he said. I then attended Johnson and Wales University in Providence, New Jersey, and was fortunate enough to get a job with Disney directly after that. I came down to Florida about two weeks after I graduated — 20 years ago now — and started working at the Liberty Tree Tavern, an old colonial tavern inside the Magic Kingdom.</p>
