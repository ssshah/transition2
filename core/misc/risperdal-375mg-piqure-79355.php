<p>Information for the user Risperdal Consta and 25,  You may need to read it again. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. Risperdal Consta with food, drink and alcohol You should avoid drinking alcohol when using Risperdal Consta.</p>
<p>Your doctor will decide if you can use it. If your baby develops any of these symptoms you may need to contact your doctor. Dizziness, tiredness, and vision problems may occur during treatment with Risperdal Consta. Do not drive or use any tools or machines without talking to your doctor first. Risperdal Consta contains less than 1 mmol sodium 23 mg per dose, i. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Risperdal Consta is given as an intramuscular injection either in the arm or buttock every two weeks, administered by a health care professional.</p>
<p>Injections should be alternated between the right and left sides, and should not be given intravenously. Risperdal Consta is used to maintain the treatment of schizophrenia, where you may see, hear or feel things that are not there, believe things that are not true or feel unusually suspicious, or confused. Do not administer intravenously see sections 4. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6. Increased mortality in elderly with dementia In a meta-analysis of 17 controlled trials of atypical antipsychotics, including oral RISPERDAL, elderly patients with dementia treated with atypical antipsychotics have an increased mortality compared to placebo.</p>
<p>The mean age range of patients who died was 86 years range  Data from two large observational studies showed that elderly people with dementia who are treated with conventional antipsychotics are also at a small increased risk of death compared with those who are not treated. There are insufficient data to give a firm estimate of the precise magnitude of the risk and the cause of the increased risk is not known. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic s of the patients is not clear.</p>
<p>Concomitant use with furosemide In the oral RISPERDAL placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia, a higher incidence of mortality was observed in patients treated with furosemide plus risperidone 7. The increase in mortality in patients treated with furosemide plus risperidone was observed in two of the four clinical trials. Concomitant use of risperidone with other diuretics mainly thiazide diuretics used in low dose was not associated with similar findings.</p>
<p>No pathophysiological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of death observed. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised and the risks and benefits of this combination or co-treatment with other potent diuretics should be considered prior to the decision to use. There was no increased incidence of mortality among patients taking other diuretics as concomitant treatment with risperidone. Irrespective of treatment, dehydration was an overall risk factor for mortality and should therefore be carefully avoided in elderly patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Cerebrovascular adverse events CVAE An approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events have been seen in randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical antipsychotics.</p>
<p>The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Orthostatic hypotension Due to the alpha-blocking activity of risperidone, orthostatic hypotension can occur, especially during initiation of treatment.</p>
<p>Clinically significant hypotension has been observed post-marketing with concomitant use of risperidone and antihypertensive treatment. Risperidone should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease e. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur.</p>
<p>The onset of extrapyramidal symptoms is a risk factor for tardive dyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all antipsychotics should be considered. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome NMS Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, altered consciousness and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported to occur with antipsychotics. Additional signs may include myoglobinuria rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.</p>
<p>Parkinson's Disease may worsen with risperidone. Both groups may be at increased risk of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medicinal products; these patients were excluded from clinical trials. Manifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms.</p>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions Although tolerability with oral risperidone should be established prior to initiating treatment with RISPERDAL CONSTA, rarely anaphylactic reactions have been reported during post-marketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone see sections 4. In some cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor.</p>
<p>Association with ketoacidosis has been reported very rarely and rarely with diabetic coma. Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines.</p>
<p>Patients treated with any atypical antipsychotic, including RISPERDAL CONSTA, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness and patients with diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Weight should be monitored regularly. Evaluation of the prolactin plasma level is recommended in patients with evidence of possible prolactin-related side effects e.</p>
<p>Tissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by prolactin.</p></p>
