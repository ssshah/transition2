		<p><p>Thank You Bevis Waters Products from Pharmacy arrive on time for me about two weeks and are about half of what I would pay locally. This is the fifth time I have ordered a 90 day supply and the products and service have always been incredible. Jordan Fuentes I can always estimate within a day or two when it will arrive.</p>
<p>The product is good, and I really like the price. Osborn I appreciated the fact that my husband received his medication in such a timely manner. Ignatius Woodard I am very pleased with my purchase. The entire transaction was simple and satisfying. This was my first purchase from a Online pharmacy, and I have to say I was extremely impressed. The shipment speed was excellent, the quality of the medicine was identical to that here in the US.</p>
<p>I will continue to do business with them. Mendez Pharmacy service is great and has saved our family a lot of money over the years! Suki Watkins This experience was very very good. The only thing I would say needs a little improvement would be the delivery time Its just a little to long Thanks for listening I will continue to use this pharmacy Xyla E. Marquez The service is excellent and my prescription was delivered on time.</p>
<p>Neru Frazier I've used online Pharmacy for years with only one problem with a shipment and the customer service team there immediately rectified the problem. I highly recommend Pharmacy. Lesley Wiley I have used NW a number of times now and I just have never had a problem with service, quality or promptness. What more can I say. Oh, yes, I am a happy customer.</p>
<p>Villarreal They are quick to fill your order, easy to work with and so very helpful. I am grateful I have Pharmacy to take care of my prescription needs. Cyrus Marks It is good to know that someone really listens to our comments! There was no serious issue but they have acknowledged and promised to improve faster response in case of any issue with order so that it can be quickly corrected and order can proceed.</p>
<p>Manning Great service and price. They called to double check the order and dealt with the doctor verifying the prescription and correcting it.</p>
<p>Guinevere Knapp Only wish the process was faster, now i know when to place my next order so that it arrives on time.</p>
<p>Levi Stevens I received the prescriptions today. Shipment came from Singapore, and the tablets are manufactured in India. I'm hoping for the best. Carroll Bechtel I was hesitant about using an online medical supplier. To my surprise the medicine I ordered was delivered fast, and the website was user friendly..</p>
<p>Thank you for Great service! I would highly recommend. Steven Watson An incredibly rapid delivery. The wedge is a little more firm harder than I would have preferred, but it will most certainly do the job for which it is intended. Will definitely use your services again. I look forward to continuing to order my diabetic supplies from this company. I will surely recommend this to others. Paul Allen I am very pleased with the products I received and the shipping. I will be ordering again very soon.</p>
<p>I really enjoy shopping online too. As with any company there are minor twerks that always need to be changed to better serve the public and sometimes they all don't work. That is the only reason why I didn't rate with 5 stars. Barnes Excellent customer service. The product arrived on time.</p>
<p>Daniel Costa I was very impressed with how quickly the order was taken care of and sent so fast. Allow up to three weeks for delivery. Edan Waters My husband, a disabled Marine had a heart attack. The VA would not cover the medicine he needed as there is a far cheaper yet far less effective drug available.</p>
<p>Shipping takes 18 business days, and despite knowing that, I was paranoid and kept calling and emailing. Every single time every person was so kind and have me all the info I needed.</p>
<p>Thank you a million times over! Hedy Mckee My experience with my purchase online went smoothly. Customer service called me back to verify some information and they were very accommodating and very polite. Delivery was much faster than expected. Overall I am very satisfied. Patel I had customer service call me at least twice to ensure that all forms were completely correctly. Ashley Electronic deduct from checking account occurred within a day or two of order and within days hence my order showed up.</p>
<p>Great experience Kendall Hawkins The cheapest by far. Easy to process and I got my meds really fast. Noble After a few mistakes by myself and my doctor the order was processed, filled and delivered quickly.</p>
<p>I have never had a problem with Online Pharmacy. Russo It takes a while to arrive, but it came within the advised day window. Can't beat the price. Waiting to try the product. Conrad Can't beat the prompt and personel service that the customer receives before and after the order has been placed. Following up with the customer is a very important reason I order from Pharmacy. Casey I would do it again but the price was a little bit more than I wanted to pay out of pocket.</p>
<p>I would like it if my insurance would pay for it. Especially if it came from your company. Callie Warren I ordered and the following day my product was on the way. That is what I call service. Simon I am well pleased with Pharmacy. Every order has been timely. The products have been a consistent quality at a substantial savings to what I paid for the name branded medication. I would highly recommend them. Garrison Order was filled as ordered without incident and arrived days ahead of scheduled date.</p>
<p>Third time without issue. One of my medications came within about three weeks. The other, they had some questions about because they were out of the dosage I ordered, but were able to provide a very reasonable resolution that would have been a hassle here in the US with more paperwork and hoops to jump through. That med took a little longer to come, but since I ordered so far in advance, it's a non-issue. You must order well in advanced. Also worth noting is that each person I spoke with on the phone was exceedingly helpful and friendly and I really appreciated that.</p>
<p>Theirs was the best price I found. Goodman user-friendly website made it easy to order top-quality supplements at a discounted price with free shipping. They fully explained the dosages and supplied scientific studies in order to back up their claims. I received my order very quickly! Monroe Good service and fast shipping. Was hesitant ordering on internet, but have been using pharmacy for a couple years now with no issues. I usually don't give many reviews but hopefully this will give someone else some piece of mind that this company is legit.</p>
<p>Hashim Harrison Have used you for years and handled professionally unlike some of those out of country sites. Great follow up with DR review of order etc. Excellent Ulla Bradshaw I love the customer service and ordering so easy to do online. Fast shipping and quick order process Brady X. Chan I have been purchasing from here for few months. Once order delayed only rest of the things been perfect. I don't find find problem to order for next time.</p>
<p>Espinoza I ordered the medications and got them before the time with the discreet packaging. Really a good service. I will recommend this pharmacy for anyone who want to get the best quality medications. Romero I got the best deal ever and it's so easy cause your doctor just sends the RX electronically. Brielle Norton this site has provided great customer care and service, a review is a view of the care provide, they never let me down, great service, and professional medical advice.</p>
<p>Great company to buy with. Sonya Rodgers I have been using pharmacy for some time. They are very professional, friendly and thorough with quick and efficient service.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend them for all of your medication needs Lareina H. Mcknight Great customer service. Have been using pharmacy for 8 years with zero problems. Products always arrive on time and the ordering process is hassle free. Hedda Ryan Order prescriptions online, the confirmation phone call took 2 minutes and delivery was one day earlier than promised. Sandoval I get great service and turnaround from this company.</p>
<p>I have experienced no issues with my years of service with them. I wish their prices were lower - they raise them pretty frequently, which doesn't speak well of how they value their customers.</p>
<p>They know we won't go elsewhere. Violet Jarvis Item exactly what was shown in image and description and shipping was very fast! Very happy with my purchase!</p>
<p>Bradford Have been a loyal customer of edrugstore. In the beginning, I had reservations about using an online pharmacy but after my first order I knew their level of professionalism and quality products would keep my business. I have absolutely no reservations and would recommend others to give them a try. There is careful screening for safe prescriptions if you answer questions truthfully.</p>
<p>Phone calls are easy and designed to assure the correct prescription. Delivery is very quick. Prices are within range of others I've seen online. Buckley I stumbled upon pharmacy through a Google search, and I thought I'd give it a try.</p>
<p>I have had a great experience every time I place an order! Just a few clicks, and my meds are on their way--no questions asked. The site is very easy to navigate, they provide excellent service, and I receive my meds with no issues whatsoever. Riley Very professional and got my supplies within 3 days.</p>
<p>I will definitely be using them for years to come! Wilkinson A little confusing to get started on the web site, but called and customer service got me through it. Good service and fast shipping. Kaufman I am so glad that my primary care physician recommended pharmacy It has been very helpful and most effective, and the people I talk with when I call are helpful and knowledgeable.</p>
<p>Whitehead I have shared this company with all my family and friends. I have had no problems with my prescriptions. I plan on using Health warehouse for more of my prescriptions. Sandra Gamble I was very nervous and clueless when i started this trek of online health and diabetic supplies, there are certainly more than one, but the one one i needed most is the one i found pharmacy,Thank You very much for answering all my questions,quick easy shipping.</p>
<p>Good family of people!! Alfreda Holt Faster shipping than expected, and great product. I'm very happy with my purchase, and will buy from your them again.</p>
<p>Natalie Gallegos Great prices, timely service. Yes, it's not instant like the local pharmacy, but the fantastic prices more than make up for the little wait. Great for reoccurring prescriptions.</p>
<p>Huffman The website was easy to use, the merchandise was shipped very quickly, and the price was great. I will continue to use pharmacy to purchase OTC items that I can't buy in volume at the local drugstore.</p>
<p>I am so pleased with the service, ease of ordering and quick shipment. I would definitely use them again. Jorden Crawford Great job and great price. Only one problem I asked for signature on arrival and I guess because it was an automatic shipment the signature service was dropped. I would have been glad to pay for it. Azalia Oliver I am very pleased with the order I received. My medication is sent to my home and is at a much lower cost even without using my insurance what a deal, oh yeah, I also get free shipping you could not ask for more.</p>
<p>Bevis Newton Again an amazing service. This time the item arrived very quickly. A very big thank you. Kenyon Carter Health Warehouse were cheaper for my two drugs than insurance. They delivered on time, even let me know and adjusted my order when I ordered more than my prescription.</p>
<p>They have a reorder feature which I like, too. Shannon Pharmacy were cheaper for my two drugs than insurance. Melendez Excellent shipping, prices, and rx transfers - never sure which manufacturer you'll receive from, which is important to me Rhiannon Y. Kemp I've been a customer for many months and other than a few small glitches with navigating the refill process when the initial prescription ran out things have been seamless. The website can give some conflicting feedback, so if you know it's wrong, you're right, and just do what is needed.</p>
<p>Ward Web site is easy to navigate, real person answers quickly when you call customer service, all prescriptions transfer from other pharmacies without any problems or delays, and prescriptions ship promply.</p>
<p>Greer Orders are processed quick. I receive my product within a few days of shipment. Great place to do business with. Meyer You guys are excellent,I didn't have to worry about tracking because you all kept me up to date on where my package were I also have to speak on the descreetness of package I will be using you all again in the future thanks again. Abra Reynolds I will definitely be ordering from here again.</p>
<p>I got exactly what I was looking for and the shipping was really fast! Barr I did a few successful transactions with them already in the past. This time there were a lot of website glitches and only wire transfer payment was accepted. I'm not coming back unless credit card or PayPal is coming back. Mason Order arrived as advertised yesterday I live in the US East Coast , and it took exactly 6 days for the order to arrive. This was my first order with SGP, but I will definitely be placing another order again soon.</p>
<p>Cooley Found what I was looking for at a great price, and received my order on time. Langley Customer service is hit and miss, different people responded to my emails and often made contradicting statements. I could never ever get them on the phone and it was not without trying a lot. Briggs Excellent and very efficient service. Good communication all the way through.</p>
<p>I would certainly recommend this company. Fay Mcfadden By the way, I got the things i ordered except for one thing that was out of stock by the time they shipped it.

Cain Pharmacy is a well organized , professionally operated online pharmacy. Packages delivered to my door and on time.</p>
<p>I have recommended them to friends and they were also very pleased with product and pricing. Estrada Service is great. No issues over the years. Prices are high, but that's life. I have been with them now for ten years. Walters I was very pleased with this order and the help I was given by the representative on the phone.. The package arrived sooner than I expected. I would appreciate if the phone service was able to be open longer for USA time.</p>
<p>Pharmacy is a well organized , professionally operated online pharmacy. I will always order and recommend your company!! Brock Received my order today - 10 days after I ordered it on-line. It was actually delivered to my home first. Since I was not home, I picked it up at the post office.</p>

They sent updated emails on my order.</p>
<p>It arrived on time. I will be using Pharmacy again. Fingers crossed they continue on that path for me. The l- isomer of amphetamine, levoamphetamine, packs a euphoric rush of norepinephrine for a quick and speedy high, with a small release of dopamine for a short period of increased alertness and focus.</p>
<p>The d- isomer of amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, produces less of an initial rush but increases the supply of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain's synaptic clefts for many hours. Both isomers of amphetamine increase arousal and stimulate the desire to be active.</p>
<p>Shire designed Adderall to maximize alertness and focus while not overdoing the initial euphoric rush, so the amphetamine mix in Adderall is only 25 percent l-amphetamine to 75 percent d-amphetamine. Mixing both isomers has been shown to increase the release of dopamine and norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft faster and longer than either of the two isomers individually, so Adderall was designed to be a quick pick-me-up, followed by hours of increased alertness and focus.</p>
<p>And by all accounts, Shire did a great job: Even though the generic version of Adderall tries to match the specific mix used by Shire, regular users will tell you that the generic pills are junk compared to the real thing. This is the power of the Adderall brand. Amphetamine potency can be measured by two things. The first is how efficiently the amphetamine molecule releases dopamine and norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft. The second is how long it takes for that amphetamine molecule to metabolize, because the longer it lingers at the synapse, the more it increases the brain's dopamine and norepinephrine supply.</p>
<p>Amphetamine's action of causing dopamine to be released into the brain's synapses from the axon terminals is fairly well understood, but less well known is how each isomer of amphetamine accomplishes this task. Dextroamphetamine, the major component of Adderall, is thought to be most efficient at releasing dopamine along the brain's D1 and D4 pathways, which help focus cognitive attention.</p>
<p>Levoamphetamine, the minor component of Adderall, is thought to be better at releasing norepinephrine and dopamine along the D2 reward pathways, causing rushes of euphoria and sexual arousal, as well as enhanced reflexes and motor coordination.</p>
<p>Although l- and d- isomers of amphetamine differ slightly in their function and effect, both stimulate the brain's pleasure and reward centers in exactly the same way, and both are highly addictive. In fact, all addictive behaviors -- drug use, sex, gambling, and so on -- are wired into to this central dopamine reward pathway, and none stimulate it better than amphetamine. Indeed, amphetamines are the most rewarding of all reward-based addictions, which is why the most potent and longest-acting form of amphetamine, dextromethamphetamine meth , is so widely coveted by addicts.</p>
<p>Methamphetamine is the end of the line for chasing the norepinephrine and dopamine rush. The mechanisms that stimulate reward and addiction are the same ones that make Adderall such a good drug for increasing focus, attention, and memory. An increased dopamine supply means more sustained focus for longer periods; an increased norepinephrine supply means stronger memory formation and better information retention.</p>
<p>This makes Adderall the drug of choice for college students who spend long hours studying or cramming for final exams. The trade in Adderall is so commonplace that it's like an underground currency: Name-brand Adderall sells for more than generics, XR capsules sell for more than the tablets, and each little pill has a milligram dosage marked on it, which means you always know the size of the dose you're getting.</p>
<p>The package is simple, neat, and perfect. But a little study boost can easily spiral into addiction. Prolonged use of Adderall and other stimulants can create dependence and even serious side effects when abused. The short-term effects of Adderall abuse include insomnia and loss of appetite, which can cause stress and malnutrition. A few days of amphetamine abuse coupled with sleep deprivation will cause paranoia and psychosis, and these symptoms will get worse until the person stops the amphetamine use and returns to a normal eating and sleeping schedule.</p>
<p>Withdrawing from an amphetamine addiction doesn't cause vomiting or sickness as with heroin, but it does cause extreme agitation, irritability and ironically an inability to focus. Long-term amphetamine addicts also report anhedonia, or the inability to feel a sense of enjoyment or pleasure without the aid of some chemical stimulant, which can linger for long periods after quitting.</p>
<p>Even though Adderall is considered safe for prescription use in pill form, it's still a Schedule II amphetamine which means it's in a less restricted category than pot, by the way , and the addiction potential is high. But does Adderall actually help students get better grades or higher test scores? For students diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, who are at a cognitive disadvantage to begin with, Adderall therapy has been shown to boost overall academic performance with long-term positive results.</p>
<p>Adderall use may help some of these students, but it can be detrimental to others, though no formal studies have been conducted to show how pervasive nonprescription Adderall use is among students and what effect, if any, it has on overall academic performance.</p>
<p>That's because there are several big problems inherent in conducting such a study, including requiring students to report their own illegal activity and collecting urine samples from them to match test scores against the presence of amphetamine metabolites in their urine. Unlike sports doping, which involves some pretty straightforward issues of fairness and testing, academic doping seems to be a much stickier problem.</p>
<p>Parents paying thousands of dollars a year for college probably don't want their children screened for performance-enhancing drugs before they can graduate -- it would open up a huge can of worms if every test score could be challenged with a request for a urine sample. And on the flip side, do you want your child to be selected for the placebo control group in a class of students being given Adderall over the course of a year to see if it helps improve their test scores overall?</p>
<p>You can see why few in academia care to consider the issue of students doping other than to say they oppose it, while admitting that the practice is widespread. In contrast to academia, the military has long recognized the use of amphetamines for performance enhancement. That's a fold increase in the number of military prescriptions for stimulants from  And the military isn't alone, because the number of civilian prescriptions is also skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Indeed, the demand for Adderall became so dramatic in that the federal government had to act to combat shortages of the drug.</p></p>
