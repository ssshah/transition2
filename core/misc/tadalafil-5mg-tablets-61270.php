		<p><p>Drug Class and Mechanism Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor type 5. It works by helping the blood flow into a penis to achieve and maintain an erection. Missed Dose If you miss a dose of Tadalafil and you still intend to engage in sexual activity, take it as soon as you remember. Continue to take it as directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Storage Instructions for Tadalafil Tablets Keep Tadalafil at room temperature away from moisture, heat and light between 59 and 86 degrees F degrees C. Store this medication out of the reach of children.</p>
<p>Taking Tadalafil with a nitrate medicine can cause a serious decrease in blood pressure, leading to fainting, stroke, or heart attack. Before taking tadalafil, tell your doctor, if you have: Side Effects of Tadalafil Tablets The most common side effects with Tadalafil are headache, indigestion, back pain, muscle aches, flushing, and stuffy or runny nose. These side effects usually go away after a few hours. Patients who get back pain and muscle aches usually get it 12 to 24 hours after taking Tadalafil.</p>
<p>Back pain and muscle aches usually go away by themselves within 36 hours. Effects of Tadalafil on Other Medicinal Products Nitrates In clinical studies, tadalafil 5, 10 and 20 mg was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates.</p>
<p>Based on the results of a clinical study in which subjects receiving daily doses of tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring.</p>
<p>Anti-hypertensives including calcium channel blockers The co-administration of doxazosin 4 and 8 mg daily and tadalafil 5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single dose increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore, this combination is not recommended see section 4.</p>
<p>In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and progressively adjusted. In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive medicinal products was examined.</p>
<p>Tadalafil 10 mg, except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was applied had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes.</p>
<p>In another clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives. In subjects taking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood pressure control.</p>
<p>In this regard, study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater, although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which with the exception of alpha-blockers - see above is, in general, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant.</p>
<p>Analysis of Phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products.</p>
<p>Riociguat Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated see section 4. However, as a formal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 5-ARIs has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 5-ARIs.</p>
<p>The only pharmacodynamic effect was a small 3. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products. Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence of this is uncertain.</p>
<p>Alcohol Alcohol concentrations mean maximum blood concentration 0. In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after co-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol absorption overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol. Tadalafil 20 mg did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol 0. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol 0. The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil 10 mg.</p>
<p>Cytochrome P metabolised medicinal products Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal products metabolised by CYP isoforms. R-warfarin Tadalafil 10 mg and 20 mg had no clinically significant effect on exposure AUC to S-warfarin or R-warfarin CYP2C9 substrate , nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin.</p>
<p>Aspirin Tadalafil 10 mg and 20 mg did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetylsalicylic acid. Antidiabetic medicinal products Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted.</p>
<p>Sudden vision loss has occurred in a small number of people taking medicines like tadalafil Viagra or others. Most of these people already had certain eye problems or risk factors for blood vessel disorders heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, smoking, or being over 50 years old. It is not clear whether the medicine was the actual cause of vision loss.</p>
<p>Tadalafil is not expected to harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether tadalafil passes into breast milk or if it could affect the nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Tadalafil is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old. How should I take tadalafil? Tadalafil is usually taken only once per day. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p>
<p>Tadalafil can be taken with or without food. Do not break or split a Cialis tablet. For erectile dysfunction, take Cialis just before sexual activity but not more than once per day. Cialis can help achieve an erection when sexual stimulation occurs. An erection will not occur just by taking a pill. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p></p>
