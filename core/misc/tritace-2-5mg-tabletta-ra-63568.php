        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Titration and maintenance dose TRITACE should be titrated by doubling the dose every one to two weeks up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. Two administrations per day are preferable.</p>
<p>Secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction and with heart failure Starting dose After 48 hours, following myocardial infarction in a clinically and haemodynamically stable patient, the starting dose is 2. If the initial 2. If the dose cannot be increased to 2. Titration and maintenance dose The daily dose is subsequently increased by doubling the dose at intervals of one to three days up to the target maintenance dose of 5 mg twice daily.</p>
<p>The maintenance dose is divided in 2 administrations per day where possible. Sufficient experience is still lacking in the treatment of patients with severe NYHA IV heart failure immediately after myocardial infarction. Should the decision be taken to treat these patients, it is recommended that therapy be started at 1. Special populations Patients with renal impairment Daily dose in patients with renal impairment should be based on creatinine clearance see section 5.</p>
<p>Patients with hepatic impairment see section 5. Elderly Initial doses should be lower and subsequent dose titration should be more gradual because of greater chance of undesirable effects especially in very old and frail patients. A reduced initial dose of 1. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of ramipril in children has not yet been established.</p>
<p>Method of administration Oral use. Significant activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is to be anticipated and medical supervision including blood pressure monitoring is necessary, for example in: Generally, it is recommended to correct dehydration, hypovolaemia or salt depletion before initiating treatment in patients with heart failure, however, such corrective action must be carefully weighed out against the risk of volume overload.</p>
<p>If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Surgery It is recommended that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as ramipril should be discontinued where possible one day before surgery.</p>
<p>Monitoring of renal function Renal function should be assessed before and during treatment and dose adjusted especially in the initial weeks of treatment. Particularly careful monitoring is required in patients with renal impairment see section 4. There is a risk of impairment of renal function, particularly in patients with congestive heart failure or after a renal transplant.</p>
<p>Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors including ramipril see section 4. This risk of angioedema may be increased in patients taking concomitant medications which may cause angioedema such as mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors e. Emergency therapy should be instituted promptly. Patient should be kept under observation for at least 12 to 24 hours and discharged after complete resolution of the symptoms.</p>
<p>These patients presented with abdominal pain with or without nausea or vomiting. Anaphylactic reactions during desensitization The likelihood and severity of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions to insect venom and other allergens are increased under ACE inhibition. Some patients may wake up short of breath at night. Fluid may collect in different parts of the body, often first noticed as swollen ankles and feet.</p>
<p>Kidney Problems Tritace may be used to treat some kidney problems. Some conditions such as diabetes and hypertension can lead to kidney problems. These problems develop slowly over several years. Good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure are important in keeping your kidneys healthy, but may not always prevent kidney damage from occurring.</p>
<p>Prevention of Cardiovascular Problems and Complications Tritace may be used to reduce the risk of some of the problems and complications that may arise in patients aged 55 or more who have problems such as coronary artery disease heart disease caused by poor blood flow in the blood vessels of the heart , peripheral vascular disease poor circulation in the hands or feet , or stroke. Tritace may also be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems and complications in patients with diabetes aged 55 years or more who may be considered at risk because of one or more additional factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, kidney problems, a current smoker, or previous disease of the blood vessels.</p>
<p>How Tritace works Tritace works by widening the blood vessels, which reduces the pressure in the vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. By increasing the supply of oxygen to your heart, your heart does not have to work as hard and it is under less stress, which may reduce the risk of further damage occurring to it following a heart attack. Tritace also improves blood flow through the small blood vessels found in the kidneys, which helps the kidneys to work more efficiently.</p>
<p>This in turn can help to slow down the progression of kidney damage that might result from having diabetes or high blood pressure. Therefore, there are quite a few reasons why your doctor might have decided to treat you with Tritace.</p>
<p>Your doctor may have also prescribed this medicine for another reason. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about why Tritace has been prescribed for you. Tritace is not addictive. Tritace is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>Before you take When you must not take it Do not take Tritace if you: Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include skin rash, itchiness, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, lips or tongue, abdominal pain, muscle pain or tenderness, or joint pain. If you have had an allergic reaction to an ACE inhibitor before, you may be allergic to Tritace. Tritace may affect your developing baby if you take it during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Tritace may pass into the breast milk and affect your breastfed baby. Do not use Tritace after the expiry date EXP printed on the pack. If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work as well. Do not use Tritace if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. Before you start to take it Tell your doctor if you have allergies to: You must also tell your doctor if you: Some medicines and Tritace may interfere with each other.</p>
<p>These medicines may be affected by Tritace, or may affect how well it works. You may need to use different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor or pharmacist will advise you. Your doctor or pharmacist may have more information on medicines to be careful with or to avoid while taking Tritace.</p>
<p>How to take Tritace How much to take Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many tablets or capsules you will need to take each day. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines. Take Tritace only when prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will select a dose when they prescribe Tritace for you.</p>
<p>Some patients may need a lower starting dose. The usual dose of Tritace is: Depending on your response, your doctor may adjust the dose. If two tablets are prescribed, your doctor may want you to take them both together or at different times.</p>
<p>This will depend on the condition being treated and how you respond to Tritace. Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p>The increase should be implemented by doubling the dose after one week of treatment. The most frequently reported side-effects are nausea, dizziness and headache. A dry cough has been reported. Syncope has been observed.</p>
<p>In patients with concomitant congestive heart failure with or without renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria or azotemia. In these patients therapy should be started under close medical supervision, and at a reduced starting dose.</p>
<p>If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. There is a risk of impairment of renal function particularly in patients with congestive heart failure or renovascular disease bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in the single kidney , in patients with pre-existing impairment of renal function as well as in kidney transplant patients. Some patients with no apparent pre-existing renal disease may develop increases in blood urea, proteinuria and serum creatinine when TRITACE is given.</p>
<p>In patients with renal insufficiency there is a risk of hyperkalaemia. Decrease in serum sodium can also occur. Liver function As TRITACE is a prodrug metabolised in the liver to its active moiety, particular caution and close monitoring should be applied in patients with liver impairment. The metabolism of the parent compound and therefore the formation of the bioactive metabolite ramiprilat may be decelerated, resulting in markedly elevated plasma levels of the parent compound due to the diminished activity of esterases in the liver.</p>
<p>If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism it can be corrected by volume expansion. Neutropenia and proteinurea Regular monitoring of white blood cell counts and protein levels in urine should be performed in patients with collagen vascular disease, such as lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, in particular where associated with impaired renal function and concomitant therapy with drugs like corticosteroids and antimetabolites.</p>
<p>Hyperkalaemia Elevated serum potassium may occur in hypertensive patients. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include renal insufficiency and the concomitant use of agents to treat hyperkalaemia as well as potassium sparing diuretics.</p>
<p>Gastro-intestinal tract Gastrointestinal disorders, e. Taste disturbances may occur. If laryngeal stridor or angio-oedema of the face, tongue or glottis occurs treatment with TRITACE must be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately.</p>
<p>Allergic reactions Hypersensitivity reactions accompanied by pruritus, rash and sometimes fever may occur, but may resolve spontaneously after withdrawal of TRITACE. Laboratory Values Increases in blood urea and serum creatinine may occur, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency or in patients pretreated with a diuretic.</p>
<p>Potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene or potassium supplements should therefore be avoided. Changes in blood picture —decrease in haemoglobin; leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene or potassium supplements increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated they should be given with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.</p>
<p>Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration.</p></p>
