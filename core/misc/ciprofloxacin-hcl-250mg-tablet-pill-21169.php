		<p><p>Cardiac disorders Caution should be taken when using fluroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, in patients with known risk factors for prolongation of the QT interval such as, for example: Therefore caution should be taken when using fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in these populations.</p>
<p>Hypoglycaemia As with other quinolones, hypoglycaemia has been reported most often in diabetic patients, predominantly in the elderly population. In all diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended see section 4. Gastrointestinal System The occurrence of severe and persistent diarrhoea during or after treatment including several weeks after treatment may indicate an antibiotic-associated colitis life-threatening with possible fatal outcome , requiring immediate treatment see section 4.</p>
<p>In such cases, ciprofloxacin should immediately be discontinued, and an appropriate therapy initiated. Anti-peristaltic drugs are contraindicated in this situation. Renal and urinary system Crystalluria related to the use of ciprofloxacin has been reported see section 4. Patients receiving ciprofloxacin should be well hydrated and excessive alkalinity of the urine should be avoided. Impaired renal function Since ciprofloxacin is largely excreted unchanged via renal pathway dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function as described in section 4.</p>
<p>Hepatobiliary system Cases of hepatic necrosis and life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported with ciprofloxacin see section 4. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatic disease such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus or tender abdomen , treatment should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Glucosephosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Haemolytic reactions have been reported with ciprofloxacin in patients with glucosephosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Ciprofloxacin should be avoided in these patients unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the possible risk.</p>
<p>In this case, potential occurrence of haemolysis should be monitored. Resistance During or following a course of treatment with ciprofloxacin bacteria that demonstrate resistance to ciprofloxacin may be isolated, with or without a clinically apparent superinfection. Cytochrome P Ciprofloxacin inhibits CYP1A2 and thus may cause increased serum concentration of concomitantly administered substances metabolized by this enzyme e. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contra-indicated.</p>
<p>Therefore patients taking these substances concomitantly with ciprofloxacin should be monitored closely for clinical signs of overdose, and determination of serum concentrations e. Methotrexate The concomitant use of ciprofloxacin with methotrexate is not recommended see section 4.</p>
<p>Interaction with tests The in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis might give false negative bacteriological test results in specimens from patients currently taking ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>Vision disorders If vision becomes impaired or any effects on the eyes are experienced, an eye specialist should be consulted immediately. Class IA and III antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, antipsychotics see section 4. Chelation Complex Formation The simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin oral and multivalent cation-containing drugs and mineral supplements e.</p>
<p>Consequently, ciprofloxacin should be administered either 1 — 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after the preparation. The restriction does not apply to antacids belonging to the class of H2 receptor blockers. Food and Dairy Products Dietary calcium as part of a meal does not significantly affect absorption.</p>
<p>However, the concurrent administration of dairy products or mineral-fortified drinks alone e. Probenecid Probenecid interferes with renal secretion of ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>Co-administration of probenecid and ciprofloxacin increases ciprofloxacin serum concentrations. Metoclopramide Metoclopramide accelerates the absorption of ciprofloxacin oral resulting in a shorter time to reach maximum plasma concentrations. No effect was seen on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin. Omeprazole Concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin and omeprazole containing medicinal products results in a slight reduction of Cmax and AUC of ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>Effects of ciprofloxacin on other medicinal products: Tizanidine Tizanidine must not be administered together with ciprofloxacin see section 4. In a clinical study with healthy subjects, there was an increase in serum tizanidine concentration Cmax increase: Increased serum tizanidine concentration is associated with a potentiated hypotensive and sedative effect. Methotrexate Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate and increased risk of methotrexate-associated toxic reactions.</p>
<p>This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details. Before using this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: Ciprofloxacin may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm QT prolongation.</p>
<p>The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using ciprofloxacin, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. Talk to your doctor about using ciprofloxacin safely. This medication may rarely cause serious changes in blood sugar , especially if you have diabetes.</p>
<p>Check your blood sugar regularly as directed and share the results with your doctor. Side effects impacting tendons can occur during the course of the treatment as well as several months following cessation of therapy. Cipro is to be strictly taken as prescribed by a physician. Ciprofloxacin should be taken every twelve hours in neither larger nor smaller amounts than prescribed.</p>
<p>The course of Cipro treatment should also not be taken for a duration that is longer than prescribed. Cipro should be swallowed with water. However, Cipro should not be taken with yogurts, milk, or juices fortified with calcium. Dairy can lessen the effectiveness of Cipro. While taking Cipro, it is important to consume extra fluid throughout the day to maintain normal kidney function. Cipro may be taken with food other than dairy at the discretion of the patient.</p>
<p>However, the time Cipro is taken should always be recorded because this medication should always be taken at the same time each day. If a dose is missed, it is important to not double the next dose. Instead, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible. Patients taking Ciprofloxacin are also advised to avoid caffeine drinks because of Cipro may intensify the effects of caffeine.</p></p>

		<h2>Ciprofloxacin</h2>
		<p>Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. For epididymo-orchitis and pelvic inflammatory diseases, empirical ciprofloxacin should only be considered in combination with another appropriate antibacterial agent e. Agomelatine In clinical studies, it was demonstrated that fluvoxamine, as a strong pill of the CYP 1A2 isoenzyme, ciprofloxacin hcl 250mg tablet pill, markedly inhibits the metabolism of agomelatine resulting in a fold increase of agomelatine exposure. However, the time Cipro is taken should always be recorded because this medication should always be taken at the same time each day. Anti-peristaltic drugs are contraindicated in this situation. The chemical <i>tablet</i> of the monohydrate is as follows: Ciprofloxacin may cause live bacterial vaccines such as typhoid vaccine to not work as well. Before using this medicationtell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: During the combination, serum theophylline concentrations should be checked and the theophylline dose reduced 250mg necessary see section 4. Prescribers are advised to take into tablet the local prevalence of pill in Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones.

Patients taking ciprofloxacin should be advised to avoid direct exposure to either extensive sunlight or UV irradiation during treatment see section 4. Ciprofloxacin should be avoided in these patients unless the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the possible risk.</p><br clear="left" />
