		<p><p>Some people with certain health conditions or who are on certain medications cannot have anti-histamine medicines. Also, if your tongue, lips, throat, or eyes swell up a lot or you are having trouble breathing- you should go to the emergency room..</p>
<p>If none of the above apply- and you are having a mild episode of hives or a mild rash or if you have seasonal allergies, you should be fine. Can you take Benadryl for allergic reactions?</p>
<p>You should consult a physician, but, yes, benadryl is an antihistamine which is effective against certain allergies. Poison Ivy and other contact dermatitis usually responds well to it.</p>
<p>Can you take Benadryl and codeine together? I have been prescribed codeine and benadryl simultaneously. It may slightly reduce the effectiveness of the codeine, but that's all.. How does Benadryl work? Diphenhydramine, the main ingredient in Benadryl, works by blocking histamine at receptor sites. It also decreases central nervous system function, causing drowsiness. Benadryl for a 10 pound dog? I have a 14lb Bishon-poo and I need to know how much lqd childrens Benadryl to give to calm her so that I can trim her.</p>
<p>I would suggest keeping a close eye on your dog and let him ride itout. There are no specific reversal agents for diphenhydramine theactive ingredient in Benadryl , so a veterinarian will simply bewatching your dog for signs of problems and you can do that athome. Benadryl overdose can result in issues like stupor and neurologicdeficits. What is in Benadryl? Benadryl is the trade name for diphenhydramine. It is mainly used to treat allergic reactions such as bee stings, or hay fever.</p>
<p>How is Benadryl metabolized? Benadryl Diphenhydramine HCl is metabolized in the liver, although it is distributed throughout the body including the central nervous system and a small amount of it passes unmetabolized in the urine. What are the withdrawals of Benadryl? If you withdraw while on benadryl you may have toxic sperm that will float back up your urethra into your stomach causing an inability to digest most foods.</p>
<p>Can you iv Benadryl? What type of high does Benadryl give you? Its a weird high The things you see are real, such as people or objects, and it is near to impossible to distinguish hallucinations from real life. Youll spend a lot of the times talking to people who aren't there or scared of something or someone that looks like its going to hurt you. Using with marijuana increases effects. In my experience, i was really frusturated about people not talking back to me and not being able to pick anything up because the things weren't actually there.</p>
<p>It is a crazy experience. How many benadryl allergy plus cold pills do you take to get high? There are 25mg of antihistamine in each pill, it would put you into a sleep that you would NOT wake up from. If you want a cheap high go to the 99 cent store and pick up a 4 oz bottle of tussin cough syrup. I do not recommend you do this though, over the summer i got addicted to that cr p and it was a b! Just go pick up some weed and listen to some good music, best high plain and simple.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many stories of people tripping off of Benadryl. This can be found in cough syrups or pills. Also, you can use pure diphenhydramine to get high, found in sleeping pills. Same goes for DXM. Does Benadryl have acetaminophen in it? Regular Benadryl is just diphenhydramine and contains no acetaminophen. There are many OTC products that have multiple ingredients. Can Benadryl be toxic to a cat? No, benadryl can't be toxic to cats OR dogs, but aspirin is toxic to cats or dogs hope this helped: Can Benadryl get you high and for how long?</p>
<p>So if you're smaller than me, it will probably last longer for you. Is it okay to take Benadryl and meth? It depends on how much benadryl you plan on taking. If you plan on intentionally overdosing on benadryl for its psychoactive effects, that would definitely not be safe. Methamphetamine releases serotonin, and, with diphenhydramine being an SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , a combination of the two could result in Serotonin Syndrome, which is a very serious and life threatening condition requiring immediate medical assistance.</p>
<p>However, if the amount of benadryl you plan on taking is consistent with the label, the effect of diphenhydramine as an SSRI would be so minor that it would fail to be therapeutically relevant. Typical doses used to achieve a Benadryl high are in the mg range. Almost all people who take this type of overdose of Benadryl will have unpleasant Benadryl side effects like nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, nervousness or anxiety and paranoia.</p>
<p>In addition the hallucinations noted with recreational Benadryl over dosage are highly unpredictable. On a quick perusal of the anecdotal web sites discussing Benadryl high essentially every discussion states that they would never try achieving a Benadryl high again because the adverse side effects outweigh the relatively minor Benadryl high. Likely for these reasons abuse of Benadryl in attempts to get a Benadryl high is probably not terribly common, especially as recurrent abuse seems the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Trust me on that. They made the decision, nobody forced them to, and no matter what pressure they were under they could have refused. Hammer it into their heads that that sort of behavior is unacceptable. Thanks for the comment. I want you all to know, I just spent the weekend, first in the E. The hallucinations were out of this world, and the aggitation was even worse!</p>
<p>It was taking 3 strong men to hold him down when ever a nurse or Dr. He would lash out, hitting, biting, or what ever he could do. He could have hurt himself, someone else, or possibly just passed out and died. You will be back to normal within 4 days. Dosages Now for the fun part.</p>
<p>Before you even attempt a Benadryl trip, pop one or two of these pills and see whether or not you have an allergic reaction. If not, then congratulations, you can trip yay? Enjoy your sedation and prepare for the trial run.</p>
<p>The trial run is so that you are familiar with the general feeling, ambience and impairment of Benadryl. It is enough to maybe have mild hallucinations but not have full on delirium.</p>
<p>It is by and far more uncomfortable than a real trip but necessary so you can decide whether or not you are up to being totally unable to tell reality from hallucination with the drug. Expect the trip to be about 5 hours but will peak after 3. You can probably go to bed after 4 hours. Well, now you are ready for a full on Benadryl trip. This won't be as uncomfortable as your trail run but it will be unsettling for different reasons.</p>
<p>Trips last about 8 hours although if mg are exceeded, expect 12 hours or more Try not to fall asleep on the come-up and take this a week after your trail run since tolerance to DPH builds up fast.

<p>I was told to take mg of it by my doctor. I was looking at giving benedryl to my dog to cure her allergy to grass not weed: You can give a dog benadryl. Which actually helps in keeping cancerous tumors at bay.</p>
<p>You need to take quite a few mg of dyphenhydramine hydrochloride to get high. Most benadryl is 25mg, so you need to take like mg to get high. Just remember not to sit down, or you will fall asleep.</p>
<p>We were using laptops that day and when I went to carry mine back to the Library it weighed me down I fell over. I only say this because.. Storys of people dying, generally dont stop idiotic people..</p></p>
