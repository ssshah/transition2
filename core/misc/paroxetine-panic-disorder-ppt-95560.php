		<p><p>When it hit me, it hit me hard. It truly was the worst experience in my life. I went from being Mr. Optimistic to worrying about every ache and pain in my body. It was a living hell. When my doctor realized what was going on with me, he put me on 20mg of Paxil. I must say the first week on it was very difficult, but I believe it's because I wasn't told or didn't hear him tell me to take half a pill for the first week.</p>
<p>After about 2 weeks or so, I woke up one morning and absolutely felt like I was on cloud 9. Not because it made me high, but because I felt normal again! I am now on 40mg and still feeling great!</p>
<p>I started having episodes when I was 17 that completely bring my life into a tailspin. I'll lose weight, sleep all the time, worry obsessively, go to the doctor a hundred times, and withdrawal from life.</p>
<p>It's torture; I feel like I'm in an alternate reality at times. The only drug that corrects me is Paxil. I get some blurred vision, vivid dreams, tremors, and swears, but it's worth it to feel normal. I feel the effects after the first dose. I started having panic attacks over a year ago, and thought it was just a phase, not realizing that I was heading towards a deep dark hole. Paroxetine put me on the right track, and 7 weeks later, I am exercising daily, have loads of energy, am seeing a psychologist and have my life in order.</p>
<p>Know this- the meds help, but it's all up to you. You have to add the rest. Don't stop after the first week. Therefore, meta-analyses of antidepressant trials are prone to overestimations of effectiveness due to publication bias. One strategy for avoiding publication bias is to conduct meta-analyses on data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration FDA in the process of obtaining drug approval, as the FDA requires that pharmaceutical companies provide information on all of the trials that they have sponsored [6].</p>
<p>However, analyses of data submitted to the FDA [5] , [7] — [9] only include trials conducted prior to approval of the medications. Pharmaceutical companies often conduct additional placebo-controlled double-blind trials after the medications have been approved. Thus, the data submitted to the FDA do not represent the most complete datasets of studies conducted with the medications. The current study addresses these potential biases by evaluating the efficacy of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI , across all placebo-controlled double-blind studies conducted by its manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, including those conducted following FDA approval.</p>
<p>As part of a lawsuit settlement, GlaxoSmithKline has been required to post online the results of all clinical trials involving its drugs on its Clinical Trial Register [10] , [11]. Thus, unlike most other antidepressants, all studies of paroxetine can be evaluated without fear of publication bias. A recent meta-analysis reported that paroxetine did not significantly differ in overall efficacy from citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, or sertraline in the treatment of depression [12].</p>
<p>Therefore, findings concerning the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of anxiety disorders could possibly generalize to other SSRIs, although further research would be necessary to support that proposition.</p>
<p>The current analysis is the first to evaluate the efficacy of an SSRI in the treatment of anxiety disorders using a complete dataset of sponsored placebo-controlled trials. Paroxetine and other SSRIs have been approved for the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder [13] — [24].</p>
<p>To date, however, only two meta-analyses have investigated the degree to which SSRIs reduce symptoms of anxiety, and both of these meta-analyses focused exclusively on panic disorder [25] , [26].</p>
<p>Notably, no meta-analyses have examined anxiety disorders other than panic disorder and none have examined whether SSRIs are differentially effective in treating different types of anxiety disorders. Further, both of these meta-analyses [25] , [26] observed evidence for publication bias in their analyses and did not have access to a full database of published and unpublished trials, indicating that these figures may be an overestimate of the true effect sizes.</p>
<p>The availability of the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trial Register provides an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of an SSRI in the treatment of anxiety disorders without a concern for publication bias.</p>
<p>The availability of a complete dataset of pre-marketing and post-marketing trials also allows for the further examination of antidepressant efficacy in the treatment of depression. The current study further evaluates the magnitude of benefit between an SSRI medication and placebo in the treatment of depression using the database of trials available through the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trial Register.</p>
<p>The goals of the current study are two-fold: Studies examining antidepressant efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders have used a wide range of outcome measures. However, a commonly used measure across double-blind trials of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder is the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety HRSA [29]. Therefore, the current study will focus on the HRSA as an indicator of anxiety-related outcomes. For both HRSA and HRSD analyses, we will analyze available moderator variables to determine which trial variables influence effect sizes in drug and placebo groups.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the lawsuit, this database is required to contain every trial sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline on their medications, including paroxetine. Thus, we do not have concerns of publication bias or selective access to studies. A total of result summaries of studies on paroxetine were downloaded. Each study was evaluated for appropriateness in the current analyses.</p>
<p>Trials were included in the current study if they met the following criteria: Examples meeting this last exclusion criterion include trials in which all participants were previously stabilized on another treatment and trials in which all participants simultaneously received treatment in addition to paroxetine.</p>
<p>Additionally, we obtained information regarding the initial approval of paroxetine from the FDA in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act [31]. This initial submission included 16 trials examining the efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of depression and utilized the HRSD as an outcome measure. These trials have been included in previous meta-analyses of antidepressant data submitted to the FDA [7] , [8].</p>
<p>In the interests of using the most complete datasets and presenting results consistent with previous meta-analyses including these trials, we used the data obtained from the FDA for these 11 trials in our analyses. Further examination revealed that the differences in sample sizes in these trials did not contribute to substantial differences in trial outcome.</p>
<p>For trials that included multiple paroxetine groups compared to placebo e. All analyses were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta Analysis 2. All analyses were conducted using both random- and fixed-effects models.</p>
<p>Equivalent results with regard to statistical significance were observed for both models in almost all analyses; thus, the fixed-effects results are presented here.</p>
<p>However, we have made the results of the random-effects models available online for interested readers see Results S1 and Figures S1 — S3. The Q [34] and I2 [35] , [36] indices were used to determine the presence or absence of homogeneity and to assess the degree of inconsistency between trials.</p></p>

With that said, it won't take care of all of it. The unsuccessful medication will be tapered off, and a medication-free period of 7 days will be established. I still had panic attacks here and there and it took me a while to realize I had to improve myself too, not just to rely solely on medication.
