		<p><p>It's also not known if the medicine passes into breast milk or could harm a breastfeeding baby. Talk to your physician before using this drug while breastfeeding. Methylprednisolone and Alcohol Methylprednisolone can cause dizziness. Alcohol use may worsen the dizziness side effects associated with this drug, so you should limit alcohol consumption while taking it.</p>
<p>Alcohol use with methylprednisolone has also been shown to increase risk for stomach bleeding. Methylprednisolone Versus Prednisone Although they have similar names, methylpredisolone and prednisone are different drugs and can't and shouldn't be used interchangeably. SingleCare, a leading online service for prescription, dental, and vision discounts, has partnered with most major pharmacies around the country to help you save up to 80 percent off prescription costs.</p>
<p>Individuals on methylprednisolone therapy should assiduously avoid exposure to measles and chicken pox, as contracting these viral infections while on high-dose corticosteroids can result in a potentially fatal viral course. Any accidental exposure to these viral infections by individuals uncertain of their immunity to chicken pox or measles should be reported immediately, as prophylactic immunoglobulin therapy may be administered.</p>
<p>Additionally, the administration of live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated for individuals taking immunosuppressive doses of methylprednisolone. The exception to this rule is patients receiving complete corticosteroid replacement therapy, e.</p>
<p>Mechanism of action[ edit ] Unbound glucocorticoids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors, modifying transcription and protein synthesis. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of MEDROL methylprednisolone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition.</p>
<p>If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective 4 mg of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone.</p>
<p>The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms , and growth suppression in children.</p>
<p>The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin ACTH while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion.</p>
<p>Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal circadian rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenal cortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenal cortical activity.
