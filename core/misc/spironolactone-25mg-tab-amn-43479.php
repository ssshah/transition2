		<p><p>Spironolactone also treats fluid retention edema in people with congestive heart failure , cirrhosis of the liver, or a kidney disorder called nephrotic syndrome. This medication is also used to treat or prevent hypokalemia low potassium levels in the blood. Spironolactone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p>
<p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: Stop using spironolactone and call your doctor at once if you have a serious side effect such as: Less serious side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.</p>
<p>Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. What is the most important information I should know about spironolactone Aldactone?</p>
<p>You should not use spironolactone if you are allergic to it, or if you have kidney disease , high levels of potassium in your blood, or if you are unable to urinate. Do not use potassium supplements or other diuretics while you are taking spironolactone. Before using this medication, tell your doctor if you have liver disease, or if you use a steroid or another diuretic.</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of spironolactone. Avoid a diet high in salt. Too much salt will cause your body to retain water and can make this medication less effective. There was also a statistically significant, but not dose related, increase in benign uterine endometrial stromal polyps in females. In 2-year studies in the rat, oral administration of potassium canrenoate was associated with myelocytic leukemia and hepatic, thyroid, testicular and mammary tumors.</p>
<p>Neither Spironolactone nor potassium canrenoate produced mutagenic effects in tests using bacteria or yeast. In the absence of metabolic activation, neither Spironolactone nor potassium canrenoate has been shown to be mutagenic in mammalian tests in vitro.</p>
<p>In the presence of metabolic activation, Spironolactone has been reported to be negative in some mammalian mutagenicity tests in vitro and inconclusive but slightly positive for mutagenicity in other mammalian tests in vitro. In the presence of metabolic activation, potassium canrenoate has been reported to test positive for mutagenicity in some mammalian tests in vitro, inconclusive in others, and negative in still others.</p>
<p>These effects were associated with retarded ovarian follicle development and a reduction in circulating estrogen levels, which would be expected to impair mating, fertility and fecundity. On a body surface area basis, this dose in the mouse is substantially below the maximum recommended human dose and, in the rabbit, approximates the maximum recommended human dose.</p>
<p>Because of its antiandrogenic activity and the requirement of testosterone for male morphogenesis, Spironolactone may have the potential for adversely affecting sex differentiation of the male during embryogenesis.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies with Spironolactone in pregnant women. Spironolactone has known endocrine effects in animals including progestational and antiandrogenic effects. The antiandrogenic effects can result in apparent estrogenic side effects in humans, such as gynecomastia. Therefore, the use of Spironolactone in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible hazards to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Canrenone, a major and active metabolite of Spironolactone, appears in human breast milk.</p>
<p>Because Spironolactone has been found to be tumorigenic in rats, a decision should be made whether to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If use of the drug is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>

Gastric bleeding, ulceration, gastritis, diarrhea and cramping, nausea, vomiting. Treatment Induce vomiting or evacuate the stomach by lavage. There is no specific antidote. Treatment is supportive to maintain hydration, electrolyte balance, and vital functions. Patients who have renal impairment may develop spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia.</p>
<p>It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone Antagonist Activity Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism.</p>
<p>Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis , and nephrotic syndrome. It is also effective in most cases of essential hypertension , despite the fact that aldosterone secretion may be within normal limits in benign essential hypertension.</p>
