How safe is Xanax during pregnancy if only needed occasionally?</p>
<p>Xanax alprazolam is classified as pregnancy Category D, which means it is not recommended for use during pregnancy because it can cause birth defects in an unborn baby. Xanax belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which if taken by a pregnant woman, can enter the fetus through the placenta. Withdrawal symptoms have been described in newborns whose mothers took Xanax during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Before taking Xanax during pregnancy, you should discuss the risks and benefits of using it with your doctor. What are the effects of Xanax on the memory?</p>
<p>Xanax alprazolam is an anxiolytic medication classified as a benzodiazepine. The exact mechanism of action of the benzodiazepines is not clearly defined. However, it is known that the benzodiazepines demonstrate depressant activity in the central nervous system. Xanax is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder and the management of anxiety disorders and anxiety associated with depression. According to the prescribing information, the reported adverse effects of benzodiazepines on the memory include concentration difficulties, transient amnesia or memory impairment.</p>
<p>During the clinical trials of panic disorder, the reported adverse effects of Xanax on the memory include memory impairment. Some of the other side effects of Xanax include drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, confusion, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, impaired coordination, irritability, dizziness, insomnia, changes in libido, weakness, sweating, rash and changes in appetite or weight.</p>
<p>What are the common side effects of Xanax? Xanax alprazolam is a benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Xanax is approved for the treatment of panic disorder. Xanax is also approved for the management of anxiety disorders, including the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and anxiety associated with depression.</p>
<p>The exact manner is which Xanax works for the treatment of panic and anxiety disorders is not fully understood. If side effects occur during treatment with Xanax, they are typically observed at the beginning of treatment and appear to resolve with continued use.</p>
<p>In a usual patient, the common side effects of Xanax are generally related to the pharmacological action of Xanax, such as drowsiness or lightheadedness. Rare reports of paradoxical reactions have been reported with benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>These reactions may include stimulation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and adverse behavioral effects agitation, rage, irritability, aggression or hostile behavior are possible. Patients are advised to discontinue Xanax treatment, under the supervision of a health care provider, if any of these paradoxical reactions occur. Xanax alprazolam belongs to a group of medications known as benzodiazepines. Xanax is approved, by the U.</p>
<p>Food and Drug Administration FDA , for the management of anxiety disorders, including anxiety related to depression and the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. Xanax is a controlled substance. The exact mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, such as Xanax, remains unknown. Clinically, Xanax exhibits a dose-related central nervous system depressant activity which ranges from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis, according to the prescribing information.</p>
<p>Xanax is approved for use in adults only. The safety and effectiveness of Xanax in patients younger than 18 years of age have not been established. The elderly may be more sensitive to the effects of Xanax. The smallest effective dose is recommended for elderly patients. Other side effects are possible with treatment. Consult with your health care provider if you experience anything unusual or bothersome while taking Xanax.</p>
<p>Xanax should not be used in patients with sensitivity to other medications in the benzodiazepine class, as well as patients with acute narrow angles glaucoma. Xanax can increase the effects of alcohol so patients are advised to avoid alcohol while taking Xanax. Xanax may be habit-forming and both physical and psychological dependence are possible with treatment.</p>
<p>Do not decrease the dose or abruptly discontinue treatment with Xanax to avoid seizures and other unpleasant, and potentially dangerous, withdrawal symptoms. If discontinuation is warranted, or desired, an appropriate taper should be determined and supervised by a physician.</p>
<p>Possible withdrawal symptoms may include blurred vision, trouble concentrating, loss of appetite, diarrhea, muscle twitching, numbness or tingling, or increased sensations. Xanax causes central nervous depressant activity so patients are cautioned against performing potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a car or engaging in any other activities that require complete mental alertness.</p>
<p>To avoid excessive central nervous system depression, patients are also advised to avoid taking Xanax with other central nervous system depressant medications, including alcohol.</p>
<p>Xanax interacts with several other medications. It is important for patients to inform the physician of all other medications they are currently taking before starting treatment with Xanax. The recommended dose of Xanax should be individualized to the patient. Low doses of Xanax should be utilized to initiate treatment to avoid adverse reactions.</p>
<p>The dosage should be increased until a therapeutic response is achieved, intolerance occurs or the recommended maximum daily dose is reached. It is recommended that the lowest possible effective dose is administered to patiens and the need for continued therapy reassessed periodically during treatment.</p>
<p>The risk for dependence increases with dose and duration of therapy. Is Xanax similar to the antidepressant Zoloft? Xanax alprazolam is a medication that is in the group of medications called benzodiazepines that are used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Antidepressants mainly work on specific chemicals in the brain: Antidepressant medications work to relieve the symptoms of depression by bringing a balance to these chemicals that are causing the problem.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines do not work to relieve depression, so they work in a different way. Benzodiazepines work by enhancing the effects of a chemical called GABA, in the brain, that produces a calming effect. Benzodiazepines have several effects on the body such as muscle relaxation, reducing anxiety, causing sleepiness, and can be used for stopping seizures. Lori Poulin, PharmD Q: Is taking up to 3 Xanax a day too many?</p>
<p>I take it for nerve pain and panic attacks that do not occur daily. But because of my personal situation of caring for an elderly parent with dementia somedays are very stressful and cause me to panic. The nerve pain has responded only to the Xanax for some relief. Not everyday do I take 3, but always 2. Xanax may be habit forming. Some of the common side effects of Xanax are: According to the prescribing information for Xanax, dosing of the medication should be individualized.</p>
<p>Like other benzodiazepines, alprazolam can be habit-forming. Risk and severity of dependence appears greater in patients taking doses larger than 4 mg daily.</p>
<p>However, smaller doses may cause dependence if alprazolam is taken longer than 12 weeks. Suddenly discontinuing alprazolam after several weeks may cause uncomfortable symptoms of withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms in people who have taken alprazolam three months or longer may include seizures , anxiety, nervousness, and headache. Patients should discuss with their doctor how to gradually discontinue alprazolam use to avoid such symptoms. Side effects The most common side effects of alprazolam include sedation, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia , and nervousness.</p>
<p>The intensity of these side effects usually declines gradually and subsides in about eight weeks. A drop in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate may also occur in people who are taking alprazolam. Switching from immediate release to extended release: Patients may be switched to extended release tablets by taking the total daily dose of the immediate release tablets and giving it once daily using the extended release preparation.</p>
<p>Preoperative anxiety off-label use: Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided. Daily dose may be decreased by 0. If withdrawal symptoms occur, resume previous dose and discontinue on a less rapid schedule. Titrate gradually, if needed and tolerated. Refer to adult dosing. Pediatric Anxiety off-label use: See "Dose Reduction" comment in adult dosing. Renal Impairment There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; use caution.</p>
