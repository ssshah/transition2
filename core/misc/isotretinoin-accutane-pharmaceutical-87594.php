		<p><p>Very rare effects include abnormal behaviour, psychosis , suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide. Beginning in , isolated case reports emerged suggesting mood change, particularly depression, occurring during or soon after isotretinoin use. Psychosis[ edit ] Isotretinoin has also been linked to psychosis. Myalgia muscular pain and arthralgia joint pain are rare side effects. Risk factors for skeletal effects include older age, greater dosage and longer course of treatment.</p>
<p>Most bone changes cause no symptoms and may only be noticed using X-ray imaging. Dry eyes are very common during treatment and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some people develop contact lens intolerance as a result. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision which may be permanent , colour blindness , development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea keratitis , swelling of the optic disk papilloedema , associated with IIH , photophobia and other visual disturbances.</p>
<p>Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands , [27] [52] hypothalamic cells, [53] hippocampus cells [54] [55] and—important for treatment of acne—in sebaceous gland cells. John's Wort , phenytoin , and systemic corticosteroids. Isotretinoin is primarily  Three metabolites of Isotretinoin are detectable in human plasma after oral administration: Isotretinoin also oxidizes, irreversibly, to 4-oxo-isotretinoin—which forms its geometric isomer 4-oxo-tretinoin.</p>
<p>Experiments completed in showed that the compound was likely to be ineffective for cancer and, surprisingly, that it could be useful to treat acne. However, they also showed that the compound was likely to cause birth defects, so in light of the events around thalidomide , Roche abandoned the product. In , Gary Peck and Frank Yoder independently rediscovered the drug's use as a treatment of cystic acne while studying it as a treatment for lamellar ichthyosis , and published that work.</p>
<p>Do not take vitamin supplements containing vitamin A while you are taking isotretinoin. Do not donate blood while taking Accutane and for at least 30 days after you stop taking it. What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking Accutane?</p>
<p>You must be registered in the program and sign documents stating that you understand the dangers of this medication and that you agree to use birth control as required by the program. Ask your doctor or call the drug maker if you have questions about the program or the written requirements. Food and Drug Administration for the safe use of this medication. Do not use this medication if you are allergic to isotretinoin or to parabens, or if you are pregnant or may become pregnant.</p>
<p>To make sure you can safely take Accutane, tell your doctor if you have any of these other conditions: Accutane can cause severe, life-threatening birth defects if the mother takes the medication during pregnancy. Even one dose of Accutane can cause major birth defects of the baby's ears, eyes, face, skull, heart, and brain. Unless you have had your uterus and ovaries removed total hysterectomy with oophorectomy or have been in menopause for at least 12 months in a row, you are considered to be of child-bearing potential.</p>
<p>Even women who have had their tubes tied are required to use birth control while taking Accutane. You must have a negative pregnancy test 30 days before you start taking Accutane. A pregnancy test is also required before each prescription is refilled, right after you take your last dose of Accutane, and again 30 days later. You must agree in writing to use two specific forms of birth control beginning 30 days before you start taking Accutane and ending 30 days after you stop taking it.</p>
<p>Both a primary and a secondary form of birth control must be used together. Primary forms of birth control include: Secondary forms of birth control include: Stop using Accutane and call your doctor at once if you have unprotected sex, if you quit using birth control, if your period is late, or if you think you might be pregnant. It is not known whether isotretinoin passes into breast milk. Do not take Accutane without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p>
<p>How should I take Accutane? Take Accutane exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. If a pregnancy does occur during isotretinoin treatment, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. All Patients Isotretinoin is contraindicated in female patients who are pregnant.</p>
<p>To receive isotretinoin all patients must meet all of the following conditions: In addition to the requirements for all patients described above, female patients of childbearing potential must meet the following conditions: The Responsible Site Pharmacist must register the pharmacy by signing and returning the completed registration form.</p>
<p>After registration, the Responsible Site Pharmacist can only activate the pharmacy registration by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I will train all pharmacists, who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions, on the iPLEDGE program requirements. I will not sell, buy, borrow, loan or otherwise transfer isotretinoin in any manner to or from another pharmacy.</p>
<p>I will return to the manufacturer or delegate any unused product if registration is revoked by the manufacturer or if the pharmacy chooses to not reactivate annually. I will not fill isotretinoin for any party other than a qualified patient. To dispense isotretinoin, the pharmacist must: Authorization signifies that the patient has met all program requirements and is qualified to receive isotretinoin.</p>
<p>Accutane isotretinoin must only be dispensed: This Accutane Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patients. Accutane isotretinoin must not be prescribed, dispensed or otherwise obtained through the internet or any other means outside of the iPLEDGE program. Only FDA-approved Accutane isotretinoin products must be distributed, prescribed, dispensed, and used.</p>
<p>Patients must fill Accutane isotretinoin prescriptions only at US licensed pharmacies. The main goal of these educational materials is to explain the iPLEDGE program requirements and to reinforce the educational messages. The iPLEDGE program is a systematic approach to comprehensive patient education about their responsibilities and includes education for contraception compliance and reinforcement of educational messages.</p>
<p>The iPLEDGE program includes information on the risks and benefits of isotretinoin which is linked to the Medication Guide dispensed by pharmacists with each isotretinoin prescription. Female patients not of childbearing potential and male patients, and female patients of childbearing potential are provided with separate booklets. The booklet for female patients not of childbearing potential and male patients, The iPLEDGE Program Guide to Isotretinoin for Male Patients and Female Patients Who Cannot Get Pregnant, also includes information about male reproduction and a warning not to share isotretinoin with others or to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of isotretinoin.</p>
<p>The booklet, The iPLEDGE Program Birth Control Workbook includes information on the types of contraceptive methods, the selection and use of appropriate, effective contraception, the rates of possible contraceptive failure and a toll-free contraception counseling line. General Although an effect of Accutane isotretinoin on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing Accutane isotretinoin to patients with a genetic predisposition for age-related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia , or other disorders of bone metabolism.</p>
<p>Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. While causality to Accutane isotretinoin has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out.</p>
<p>Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when Accutane isotretinoin is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE program patient educational materials. Female patients of childbearing potential must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when Accutane isotretinoin therapy is initiated, and that they should use 2 forms of effective contraception simultaneously for 1 month before starting Accutane isotretinoin , while taking Accutane isotretinoin , and for 1 month after Accutane isotretinoin has been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse.</p>
<p>They should be given an opportunity to view the patient DVD provided by the manufacturer to the prescriber. The DVD includes information about contraception, the most common reasons that contraception fails, and the importance of using 2 forms of effective contraception when taking teratogenic drugs and comprehensive information about types of potential birth defects which could occur if a female patient who is pregnant takes Accutane isotretinoin at any time during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Accutane isotretinoin is found in the semen of male patients taking Accutane isotretinoin , but the amount delivered to a female partner would be about 1 million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of postmarketing reports include 4 with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however 2 of these reports were incomplete, and 2 had other possible explanations for the defects observed.</p>
<p>Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Accutane isotretinoin treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment.</p></p>
