		<p><p>Sulfasalazine mg passes into breast milk and could have undesirable effects on a nursing infant. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding. Store at room temperature away from light and moisture. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep all medications away from children and pets. Do not flush medications down the toilet or pour them into a drain unless instructed to do so. Properly discard this product when it is expired or no longer needed.</p>
<p>Consult your pharmacist or local waste disposal company. Sulfasalazine mg is used to treat a certain type of bowel disease called ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine mg does not cure this condition, but it helps decrease symptoms such as fever, stomach pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding.</p>
<p>After an attack is treated, Sulfasalazine mg is also used to increase the amount of time between attacks. Sulfasalazine mg works by reducing irritation and swelling in the large intestines. In addition, delayed-release tablets of Sulfasalazine mg are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Sulfasalazine mg helps to reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.</p>
<p>Sulfasalazine mg is used with other drugs, rest, and physical therapy in patients who have not responded to other medications salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs. Take Sulfasalazine mg by mouth after meals with a full glass of water 8 ounces or milliliters or as directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>To prevent stomach upset, your doctor may recommend a slow increase in your dosage when starting treatment. Dosage of Sulfasalazine mg is based on your medical condition and response to therapy. In children, dosage is also based on weight. If you are taking the delayed-release tablets, swallow them whole. Do not crush, chew, or break the tablets. Doing so may increase the chance of stomach upset. Drink plenty of fluids during treatment with Sulfasalazine mg unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>This will help prevent kidney stones. Take Sulfasalazine mg regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it at the same times each day. Severe hypersensitivity reactions may include internal organ involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, myocarditis, mononucleosis-like syndrome i.</p>
<p>Serious skin reactions, some of them fatal, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported in association with the use of Sulfasalazine.</p>
<p>Patients are at highest risk for these events early in therapy, with most events occurring within the first month of treatment. Sulfasalazine should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Severe, life-threatening, systemic hypersensitivity reactions such as drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported in patients taking Sulfasalazine. Early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Sulfasalazine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p>
<p>Precautions General Sulfasalazine tablets should be given with caution to patients with severe allergy or bronchial asthma. Adequate fluid intake must be maintained in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation. Patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should be observed closely for signs of hemolytic anemia. This reaction is frequently dose related. If toxic or hypersensitivity reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the possibility of adverse reactions and of the need for careful medical supervision.</p>
<p>The occurrence of sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura, or jaundice may indicate a serious blood disorder. Should any of these occur, the patient should seek medical advice. They should also be made aware that ulcerative colitis rarely remits completely, and that the risk of relapse can be reduced by continued administration of Sulfasalazine at a maintenance dosage.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to take Sulfasalazine tablets in evenly divided doses preferably after meals. Additionally, patients should be advised that Sulfasalazine may produce an orange-yellow discoloration of the urine or skin. Laboratory Tests Complete blood counts, including differential white cell count and liver function tests, should be performed before starting Sulfasalazine and every second week during the first three months of therapy.</p>
<p>During the second three months, the same tests should be done once monthly and thereafter once every three months, and as clinically indicated. Urinalysis and an assessment of renal function should also be done periodically during treatment with Sulfasalazine. Drug Interactions Reduced absorption of folic acid and digoxin have been reported when those agents were administered concomitantly with Sulfasalazine. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papillomas was observed in male rats.</p>
<p>The increased incidence of neoplasms in the urinary bladder and kidney of rats was also associated with an increase in the renal calculi formation and hyperplasia of transitional cell epithelium. The incidence of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma in male and female mice was significantly greater than the control at all doses tested.</p>
<p>Sulfasalazine did not show mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation assay Ames test and in L mouse lymphoma cell assay at the HGPRT gene. However, Sulfasalazine showed equivocal mutagenic response in the micronucleus assay of mouse and rat bone marrow and mouse peripheral RBC and in the sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberration, and micronucleus assays in lymphocytes obtained from humans. Oligospermia and infertility have been described in men treated with Sulfasalazine.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of the drug appears to reverse these effects. Pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sulfasalazine in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>There have been case reports of neural tube defects NTDs in infants born to mothers who were exposed to Sulfasalazine during pregnancy, but the role of Sulfasalazine in these defects has not been established.</p>
<p>However, oral Sulfasalazine inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid which may interfere with folic acid supplementation see Drug Interactions and diminish the effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation that has been shown to decrease the risk of NTDs.</p>
<p>A national survey evaluated the outcome of pregnancies associated with inflammatory bowel disease IBD. In a group of women treated with Sulfasalazine alone or Sulfasalazine and concomitant steroid therapy, the incidence of fetal morbidity and mortality was comparable to that for untreated IBD pregnancies as well as to pregnancies in the general population.</p>
<p>Clinical Considerations Sulfasalazine and its metabolite, sulfapyridine, pass through the placenta. Sulfasalazine and its metabolite are also present in human milk. In the newborn, sulfonamides compete with bilirubin for binding sites on the plasma proteins and may cause kernicterus.</p>
<p>Although sulfapyridine has been shown to have a poor bilirubin-displacing capacity, monitor the newborn for the potential for kernicterus. A case of agranulocytosis has been reported in an infant whose mother was taking both Sulfasalazine and prednisone throughout pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Sulfonamides, including Sulfasalazine, are present in human milk see Pregnancy, Clinical Considerations. Insignificant amounts ofSulfasalazine have been found in milk, whereas levels of the active metabolite sulfapyridine in milk are about 30 to 60 percent of those in the maternal serum.</p>
<p>Sulfasalazine EC mg does not cure this condition, but it helps decrease symptoms such as fever, stomach pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. After an attack is treated, sulfasalazine is also used to increase the amount of time between attacks. Sulfasalazine EC mg works by reducing irritation and swelling in the large intestines.</p>
<p>In addition, delayed-release tablets of sulfasalazine are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Sulfasalazine helps to reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Sulfasalazine EC mg is used with other drugs, rest, and physical therapy in patients who have not responded to other medications salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs. Take Sulfasalazine EC mg by mouth after meals with a full glass of water 8 ounces or milliliters or as directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>To prevent stomach upset, your doctor may recommend a slow increase in your dosage when starting treatment. Dosage of Sulfasalazine EC mg is based on your medical condition and response to therapy. In children, dosage is also based on weight. If you are taking the delayed-release tablets, swallow them whole. Do not crush, chew, or break the tablets. Doing so may increase the chance of stomach upset. Drink plenty of fluids during treatment with Sulfasalazine EC mg unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>This will help prevent kidney stones. Take Sulfasalazine EC mg regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it at the same times each day. Inform your doctor if your condition does not improve or if it worsens. For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, it may take months before you notice any improvement in your symptoms. Stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, or unusual tiredness may occur.</p>
<p>If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Sulfasalazine EC mg may cause your skin and urine to turn orange-yellow. This effect is harmless and will disappear when the medication is stopped. Rarely, delayed-release tablets of sulfasalazine may appear whole or only partly dissolved in your stool.</p>
<p>If this occurs, tell your doctor right away so your treatment can be changed. Remember that your doctor has prescribed Sulfasalazine EC mg because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects.</p></p>
