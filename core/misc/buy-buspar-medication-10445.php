		<p><p>If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Consequently, when administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, a low dose of buspirone used cautiously is recommended.</p>
<p>When used in combination with a potent inducer of CYP3A4 the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect. Protein Binding In vitro, buspirone does not displace tightly bound drugs like phenytoin, propranolol, and warfarin from serum proteins. However, there has been one report of prolonged prothrombin time when buspirone was added to the regimen of a patient treated with warfarin.</p>
<p>In vitro, buspirone may displace less firmly bound drugs like digoxin. The clinical significance of this property is unknown. It has been mistakenly read as metanephrine during routine assay testing for pheochromocytoma, resulting in a false positive laboratory result. Buspirone hydrochloride should therefore be discontinued for at least 48 hours prior to undergoing a urine collection for catecholamines.</p>
<p>Druag Abuse and Dependencee Buspirone hydrochloride is not a controlled substance. Physical And Psychological Dependence In human and animal studies, buspirone has shown no potential for abuse or diversion and there is no evidence that it causes tolerance, or either physical or psychological dependence. Human volunteers with a history of recreational drug or alcohol usage were studied in two doubleblind clinical investigations. None of the subjects were able to distinguish between buspirone hydrochloride tablets and placebo.</p>
<p>By contrast, subjects showed a statistically significant preference for methaqualone and diazepam. Studies in monkeys, mice, and rats have indicated that buspirone lacks potential for abuse. Following chronic administration in the rat, abrupt withdrawal of buspirone did not result in the loss of body weight commonly observed with substances that cause physical dependency. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of buspirone hydrochloride tablets misuse or abuse e.</p>
<p>Controlled Substance Class Buspirone hydrochloride is not a controlled substance. There have been reports of the occurrence of elevated blood pressure when buspirone hydrochloride tablets have been added to a regimen including an MAOI.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended that buspirone hydrochloride tablets not be used concomitantly with an MAOI. Because buspirone hydrochloride tablets have no established antipsychotic activity, it should not be employed in lieu of appropriate antipsychotic treatment. However, its CNS effects in any individual patient may not be predictable.</p>
<p>Therefore, patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or using complex machinery until they are reasonably certain that buspirone treatment does not affect them adversely. While formal studies of the interaction of buspirone hydrochloride with alcohol indicate that buspirone does not increase alcohol-induced impairment in motor and mental performance, it is prudent to avoid concomitant use of alcohol and buspirone.</p>
<p>Therefore, before starting therapy with buspirone hydrochloride tablets, it is advisable to withdraw patients gradually, especially patients who have been using a CNS-depressant drug chronically, from their prior treatment.</p>
<p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light. Dosage Information in more detail What happens if I miss a dose? Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. What happens if I overdose? Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at  What should I avoid? This medication may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert.</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol may increase certain side effects of BuSpar. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with buspirone and lead to unwanted side effects. Discuss the use of grapefruit products with your doctor. BuSpar side effects Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction to BuSpar: Major Because of the potential risk and severity of serotonin syndrome, caution should be observed when coadministering drugs that have serotonergic properties such as buspirone and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRIs.</p>
<p>If serotonin syndrome occurs, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated. Moderate Potent inducers of hepatic cytochrome P 3A4, such as dexamethasone, may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. Moderate Dicyclomine can cause drowsiness, so it should be used cautiously in patients receiving CNS depressants like buspirone. Minor Buspirone can displace digoxin from plasma proteins, but the clinical significance of this effect has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Moderate Coadministration of buspirone with diltiazem substantially increases the plasma concentration of buspirone. During coadministration with diltiazem, close monitoring is suggested, with adjustment of buspirone dosage if needed. Moderate Use caution if coadministration of dronabinol with buspirone is necessary, and monitor for additive dizziness, confusion, somnolence, and other CNS effects.</p>
<p>Buspirone is a substrate for CYP3A4. The concomitant administration of dronedarone and CYP3A substrates may result in increased exposure of the substrate and should, therefore, be undertaken with caution. Major CNS depressants have additive effects with droperidol. Following administration of droperidol, lower doses of the other CNS depressant should be used. Moderate Substances that are inducers of hepatic cytochrome P isoenzyme CYP3A4, such as efavirenz, may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism.</p>
<p>In a study of healthy volunteers, co-administration of buspirone with rifampin decreased the plasma concentrations  Efavirenz; Lamivudine; Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Moderate Administering buspirone with elbasvir; grazoprevir may result in elevated buspirone plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>If these drugs are used together, closely monitor for signs of adverse events. Moderate Monitor for decreased efficacy of buspirone if enzalutamide is added to a patient on a stable dosage of buspirone; a dose increase of buspirone may be needed to maintain anxiolytic activity.</p>
<p>Moderate Concomitant administration of erythromycin with buspirone may result in significant increases in buspirone AUC; the mechanism is probably reduced buspirone metabolism via CYP3A4. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone is recommended.</p>
<p>Major Because of the potential risk and severity of serotonin syndrome, caution should be observed when coadministering drugs that have serotonergic properties such as buspirone and escitalopram. Moderate Hydantoins are potent inducers of hepatic cytochrome P isoenzyme CYP3A4 and may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism.</p>
<p>An in vitro study indicated that buspirone did not displace highly protein-bound drugs such as phenytoin. Major Concomitant use of fentanyl with other CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of fentanyl on respiration, CNS depression, sedation, and hypotension. Major Because of the potential risk and severity of serotonin syndrome, caution should be observed when coadministering drugs that have serotonergic properties such as buspirone and fluoxetine.</p>
<p>In addition, buspirone is a primary CYP3A4 substrate and concurrent use with an inhibitor of CYP3A4, such as fluoxetine, may decrease systemic clearance of buspirone leading to increased or prolonged effects. If buspirone is administered with fluoxetine, a low initial dose of buspirone is advisable with subsequent dosage adjustments based on clinical response.</p>
<p>Patients receiving this combination should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or other adverse effects. Major Because of the potential risk and severity of serotonin syndrome, caution should be observed when coadministering drugs that have serotonergic properties such as buspirone and fluvoxamine. In addition, buspirone is a primary CYP3A4 substrate and concurrent use with an inhibitor of CYP3A4, such as fluvoxamine, may decrease systemic clearance of buspirone leading to increased or prolonged effects.</p>
<p>If buspirone is administered with fluvoxamine, a low initial dose of buspirone is advisable with subsequent dosage adjustments based on clinical response. Major Buspirone should be taken consistently with or without food because food decreases the presystemic clearance of buspirone. Moderate When buspirone is administered with an inhibitor of CYP3A4 like fosamprenavir, a lower dose of buspirone is recommended. Moderate General anesthetics potentiate the effects of CNS depressants.</p>
<p>Major Patients receiving buspirone should be advised to avoid drinking large amounts of grapefruit juice. In a study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone 10 mg single dose with grapefruit juice mL double-strength three times daily for 2 days increased plasma buspirone concentrations significantly 4.</p>
<p>Subjective drowsiness and other side effects of buspirone, like dizziness, nausea, headache, nervousness, or restlessness. Moderate The combination of buspirone and CNS depressants like the antipsychotics can increase the risk for sedation.</p>
<p>Mild to moderate increases in haloperidol plasma concentrations have been reported during concurrent use of haloperidol and CYP3A4 substrates such as buspirone. Elevated haloperidol concentrations may increase the risk of adverse effects, including QT prolongation. Until more data are available, it is advisable to closely monitor for adverse events when buspirone is coadministered with haloperidol. Hydrocodone; Potassium Guaiacolsulfonate; Pseudoephedrine: Moderate Concomitant use of CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of hydromorphone, which may potentially lead to respiratory depression, CNS depression, sedation, or hypotensive responses.</p>
<p>Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as imatinib, may decrease systemic clearance of buspirone leading to increased or prolonged effects. Moderate When buspirone is administered with an inhibitor of CYP3A4 like indinavir, a lower dose of buspirone is recommended. Moderate Concomitant use of isavuconazonium with buspirone may result in increased serum concentrations of buspirone. Buspirone is a substrate of the hepatic isoenzyme CYP3A4; isavuconazole, the active moiety of isavuconazonium, is a moderate inhibitor of this enzyme.</p>
<p>Caution and close monitoring are advised if these drugs are used together. Severe Concomitant use of MAOIs and buspirone is contraindicated because several cases of elevated blood pressure have been reported in patients taking MAO inhibitors who were then given buspirone HCL.</p>
<p>A day interval after discontinuing isocarboxazid is recommended before initiating buspirone treatment. Major Substances that are potent inducers of hepatic cytochrome P isoenzyme CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism. Major A low dose of buspirone is recommended e.</p>
<p>In a study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone with itraconazole increased the AUC and Cmax of buspirone by fold and fold, respectively. These pharmacokinetic interactions were accompanied by an increased incidence of side effects attributable to buspirone.</p>
<p>Moderate Use caution when administering ivacaftor and buspirone concurrently. Ivacaftor is an inhibitor of CYP3A. Co-administration of ivacaftor with CYP3A substrates, such as buspirone, can increase buspirone exposure leading to increased or prolonged therapeutic effects and adverse events.</p>
<p>Kava Kava, Piper methysticum: Major Any substance that acts on the CNS may interact with kava kava. These interactions are probably pharmacodynamic in nature. Patients should probably avoid concomitant administration. Moderate Pharmacokinetic data suggest that concomitant administration of ketoconazole and buspirone results in significant up to fold increases in buspirone AUC; the mechanism is probably reduced buspirone metabolism via CYP3A4.</p>
<p>However, a wide interindividual variability in the extent of the interaction has been noted. Some patients receiving these drugs with buspirone concurrently have reported lightheadedness, asthenia, dizziness, and drowsiness. Moderate Lesinurad may decrease the systemic exposure and therapeutic efficacy of buspirone; monitor for potential reduction in efficacy.</p>
<p>Moderate Administering letermovir with buspirone may increase buspirone concentration and risk for adverse events. The magnitude of this interaction may be increased in patients who are also receiving cyclosporine.</p>
<p>If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone. Consequently, when administered with both letermovir and cyclosporine, a low dose of buspirone used cautiously is recommended. Buspirone is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4. Letermovir is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. Moderate Concomitant use of CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of levomethadyl, which may potentially lead to respiratory depression, CNS depression, sedation, or hypotensive responses.</p>
<p>Moderate Concomitant use of CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of levorphanol, which may potentially lead to respiratory depression, CNS depression, sedation, or hypotensive responses.</p>
<p>Moderate Linezolid should generally not be administered to patients taking serotonergic agents, such as buspirone, due to the potential for serious CNS reactions, such as serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome has been reported when linezolid has been administerd with certain serotonergic agents. In theory, serotonin syndome could occur with the concomitant use of buspirone; however, the FDA states that it is unclear if concomitant use of linezolid and agents with lesser degrees of serotonergic activity would pose a comparable risk.</p>
<p>Linezolid is an antibiotic that is also a reversible, non-selective MAO inhibitor. Several cases of elevated blood pressure have been reported in patients in whom buspirone was added to a non-selective traditional MAO-inhibitor regimen. Major There is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome during concurrent use of drugs with central serotonergic properties such as lithium and buspirone. Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include autonomic instability e.</p>
<p>If concurrent use is necessary, monitor for the emergence of serotonin syndrome and inform patients of the increased risk. If serotonin syndrome is suspected, serotonergic agents should be discontinued and appropriate medical treatment should be implemented. Moderate When buspirone is administered with an inhibitor of CYP3A4 like lopinavir, a lower dose of buspirone is recommended. Moderate Lumacaftor; ivacaftor may reduce the efficacy of buspirone by decreasing its systemic exposure.</p>
<p>A buspirone dosage adjustment may be necessary to maintain anxiolytic activity. Lumacaftor is a strong CYP3A inducer. Buspirone has been shown in vitro to be metabolized via CYP3A4; this finding is consistent with in vivo interactions observed. Moderate CNS depressants should be combined cautiously with maprotiline because they could cause additive depressant effects and possible respiratory depression or hypotension. Moderate Concomitant use of CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of meperidine, which may potentially lead to respiratory depression, CNS depression, sedation, or hypotensive responses.</p>
<p>Moderate Concomitant use of CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of methadone, which may potentially lead to respiratory depression, CNS depression, sedation, or hypotensive responses.</p>
<p>Moderate CNS depression can be increased when methscopolamine is combined with other CNS depressants such as any anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics. Minor Combined use of metoclopramide and other CNS depressants, such as anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics, can increase possible sedation.</p>
<p>Moderate Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as mifepristone, may decrease systemic clearance of buspirone leading to increased concentrations or prolonged effects. Moderate Although unlikely to occur with use of mirtazapine alone, there have been rare case reports of serotonin syndrome with the drug. Coadministration of buspirone, which potentiates the actions of serotonin, may result in serotonin syndrome.</p>
<p>Major Use caution if mitotane and buspirone are used concomitantly, and monitor for decreased efficacy of buspirone and a possible change in dosage requirements. Mitotane is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and buspirone is a CYP3A4 substrate in vitro; coadministration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of buspirone. Moderate Concomitant use of CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of morphine, which may potentially lead to respiratory depression, CNS depression, sedation, or hypotensive responses.</p>
<p>If concurrent use of morphine and buspirone is imperative, reduce the dose of one or both drugs. Moderate Concomitant use of nabilone with other CNS depressants can potentiate the effects of nabilone on respiratory depression.</p>
<p>Moderate Concomitant use of nalbuphine with other CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of nalbuphine on respiratory depression, CNS depression, and sedation. Major The administration of nefazodone with buspirone has resulted in marked increases in plasma buspirone concentrations most likely due to CYP3A4 inhibition by nefazodone. Some patients receiving both drugs concurrently have reported lightheadedness, asthenia, dizziness, and drowsiness.</p>
<p>If buspirone is to be administered concurrently with nefazodone, a low dose of buspirone, such as 2. Moderate When buspirone is administered with an inhibitor of CYP3A4 like nelfinavir, a lower dose of buspirone is recommended.</p>
<p>Co-administration with nicardipine may lead to an increase in serum levels of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates including buspirone.</p>
<p>A buspirone dose reduction may be necessary if these drugs are used together. Plasma concentrations and efficacy of buspirone may be reduced if these drugs are administered concurrently.</p>
<p>Moderate Additive CNS depression may occur when oxybutynin is used concomitantly with other CNS-depressant drugs, including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics. Moderate Concomitant use of CNS depressants, such as buspirone, can potentiate the effects of oxymorphone, which may potentially lead to respiratory depression, CNS depression, sedation, or hypotensive responses.</p>
<p>Moderate Monitor for an increase in buspirone-related adverse reactions if coadministration with palbociclib is necessary. If palbociclib is added to a patient stabilized on buspirone, a buspirone dose adjustment may be necessary to avoid adverse events. Moderate Concurrent use of papaverine with potent CNS depressants such as buspirone could lead to enhanced sedation.</p>
<p>Major Because of the potential risk and severity of serotonin syndrome, caution should be observed when coadministering drugs that have serotonergic properties such as buspirone and paroxetine. Coadministration of pazopanib and buspirone, a CYP3A4 substrate, may cause an increase in systemic concentrations of buspirone.</p>
<p>Use caution when administering these drugs concomitantly. The combination of perampanel particularly at high doses with ethanol has led to decreased mental alertness and ability to perform complex tasks such as driving , as well as increased levels of anger, confusion, and depression; similar reactions should be expected with concomitant use of other CNS depressants, such as buspirone.</p>
<p>Major Although not specifically studied, coadministration of CNS depressant drugs with topiramate may potentiate CNS depression such as dizziness or cognitive adverse reactions, or other centrally mediated effects of these agents. Monitor for increased CNS effects if coadministering. Moderate Posaconazole and buspirone should be coadministered with caution due to an increased potential for buspirone-related adverse events.</p></p>
