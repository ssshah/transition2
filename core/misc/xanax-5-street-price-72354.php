		<p><p>Ancient Bam, or the Arg-i-Bam, at its peak of political, economic, and military power had some 11, citizens living in houses within its city walls, which still stand much the way they did hundreds of years ago. Since the city's inception, judged to be between BC. It was not until a devastating Afghan invasion in , which crippled the city and forced its inhabitants to flee, that Bam's downfall began.</p>
<p>Existing in shadows of its own historical greatness from and , the city eventually closed its illustrious gates to civilians at the turn of the century. For the forty-year period following, the city was an active military barracks, and then lay vacant until the restoration process began in the early s. A moment is all it will take for you long to realize that Bam is an extraordinary historical site.</p>
<p>Many of the well-visited historical sites in the world, such as the Acropolis in Athens and the Coliseum in Rome, only give the archaeologist and tourist a limited slice of history.</p>
<p>Bam, on the other hand, clearly displayed the imprints of over years of continuous history. Surrounded by inhospitable deserts and mountains, the Arg-i-Bam seemed to shine out amongst its inhospitable surroundings. When you strolled through front gates, you came face to face with ancient Bam. Houses, schools, mosques, gymnasiums, and bathhouses stand in the same places they did centuries ago.</p>
<p>These structures maintained their allure, and they had the rare ability to give visitors a most inspiring adrenaline rush at first sight.</p>
<p>There's so much pressure on teenagers today to get those A-stars, to be pretty, to be popular GP Carolyn Barshall 'They want to stop worrying about exams, about succeeding, about what comes after school or after uni,' she says.</p>
<p>There's so much pressure on teenagers today to get those A-stars, to be pretty, to be popular. It sounds far less alarming than shooting up heroin or smoking crack cocaine, but Xanax is extremely dangerous when misused. Like all benzodiazepines, it changes the way the brain works by suppressing the neurotransmitter GABA, a chemical in the brain which inhibits the activity of nerves. In adolescents, the brain is still developing: Worse, warns Dr Weis, after prolonged exposure to the drug, 'abrupt withdrawal leads to a syndrome that may include anything from anxiety, panic attacks and tremors to hallucinations, seizures, psychosis and suicide.</p>
<p>Like all benzodiazepines, Xanax changes the way the brain works by suppressing the neurotransmitter GABA, a chemical in the brain which inhibits the activity of nerves.</p>
<p>Stock Only last month a group of girls from Burntwood School in Wandsworth, South London, were rushed to hospital after taking Xanax during their lunch break. Earlier this year, eight children, aged 15 and 16, in Wiltshire received hospital treatment after taking it. While Louise's daughter Darcy escaped without such severe consequences, she was left deeply shaken by the profound effect the drug had on her.</p>
<p>Darcy admits that although she and her friends were using 1. A standard initial dose prescribed for anxiety by doctors in the U. The usual maximum recommended dose is no more than 4mg. Like many users, Darcy and her friends tended to take Xanax while drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>The latter drug, of course, reduces a drinker's ability to make sensible choices — and it, too, affects the GABA neurotransmitter, meaning the two substances could interact in harmful ways.</p>
<p>One night Darcy and her friends decided to increase their dose to 5mg. So I got scared. I knew I had to stop the Xanax. It was getting out of control. It was getting out of control Teenager Darcy It had taken only four months for Darcy's use of Xanax to spiral into something dangerous. And when she tried to stop, Darcy suffered flu-like symptoms of aching bones and headaches and felt on a permanent short fuse.</p>
<p>He says it became part of a cocktail of 'party drugs' including the tranquilliser ketamine, with 4mg of Xanax taken at the end of an evening to help him relax and get to sleep.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if I could take the Suboxone for about days while slowly weening myself off of the Xanax? I know there are precautions but if anyone has first hand experience, I wanted to know if I could do this, or if it was a very good possibility that I woudl have problems doing so?</p>
<p>GL glendola 29 Aug I hate to be plainly obvious with you, but both oxycontin and xanax are very hard to withdraw from. This is a drug that allows you to withdraw from opiates oxycontin , and it isn't like methadone that has to be administered every day, and that itself has horrible withdrawal. I've been on it for 2 years, which is an extended period of time, but that's because I'm afraid of what might happen if I were to come off of it. I've been reassured by many people that the withdrawal is insignifcant.</p>
<p>I have to tell you that Suboxone has all but gotten rid of all my side effects and has increased my mood. The only problem you may have is that not all doctor's can prescribe this medication. You would have to look on line and find a doc close to you. I can't impress enough how beneficial this drug has been.</p>
<p>The only thing is I don't know if it's helpful in coming off xanax. If you have any questions, call me  GL glendola 29 Aug To add to my previous comment, I somehow didn't realize that your doctor has already been reluctant to give you Suboxone considering your xanax use.</p>
<p>I've been taking clonazepam, which is in the same family as xanax, and I have had no problems, and as I said I'm been taking Suboxone for 2 years, and since I was having anxiety the doctor prescribed Clonazepam. Mabye that is the safer of the 2, and I have to say that clonazepam is effective much longer than xanax. It seemed every time I took xanax, I was needing to take more within 3 hours. GL glendola 29 Aug Here I am again, I think that if you titrate down slowly from the xanax you might not have a problem.</p>
<p>I don't know the dosage of xanax you are on, but If they ween you off slowly, as slowly as it takes, theres no rush here, I don't see a reason that couldn't be effective in doing so. I know that coming off a drug such as xanax can sometimes be fatal to the system, not to scare you, but there's no reason to come off so slowly, and as far as coming off the oxycontin, you won't die from it, you will just wish you were dead because of the wicked physical and moreso mental anguish. IZ izzothecat 23 Dec Just to add to all of the comments listed on this first response: Both Xanax and Klonopin are BZDs that will lead to the same level of addiction; the only difference between the two is that Klonopin has a longer half-life Anyway, anyone who wants to come off of a BZD would be best to find a doctor who would help them taper off using the Ashton method you can find the full version of the Ashton Manual online simply by searching for it Anyone who is in this dilemma should check it out ASAP.</p>
<p>Also, just as a note, it has been shown that patients who have been on Klonopin for an extended period of time generally find it much more difficult to taper off under the Ashton method in contrast to those using the shorter acting BZDs such as Xanax and Ativan. I'm not completely sure as to why this has been the case, but my best guess is that it is directly related to the extended relief a person receives from the longer acting Klonopin.</p>
<p>In fact, there are doctors who actually switch patients from Xanax to Klonopin in order to taper them off of BZDs altogether without knowing that this is, in fact, actually doing more harm than good. If anyone needs help finding the site, let me know I take 24mlg of suboxone a day and 4mg of xanax a day and i see a counsler also. She wants me to get off the xanax, but my anxiety would be through the roof, she is now saying my levels arn't matching and moving up and down. I talked to the doctor about it, and he said that was natural.</p>
<p>What does anyone know about this?</p></p>
