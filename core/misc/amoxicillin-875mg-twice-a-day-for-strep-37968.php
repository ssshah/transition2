		<p><p>I have no tooth pain. Last week I had a filling replaced and one other filling on the same quandrant upper right. I have been on the antiobiotics plus paridex for 5 days, but I am not seeing much improvement.</p>
<p>The swelling is worse in the morning upon waking. Read More I took him to the emergency room and they said it may be a reaction to a viral infection and prescribed amoxicillian for 10 days It has been 6 days and still they are bleeding He is too young for gum disease, right?</p>
<p>Read More Okay so I have a gum infection around my wisdom tooth, pericoronitis. I want to get a operculectomy to remove the gums and hopefully it'll solve the infection. Read More The doctor I went to gave me Amoxicillin , and I've been taking that for about a week, and I've got another weeks worth to take as well. And sure, that'd be fine, but I have this huge problem with it. There's this constant burn in the back of my throat, and whenever I breathe I can taste this awful, awful something.</p>
<p>My breath doesn't smell bad, and there's nothing back there, but it's the worst taste I can imagine and it never goes away. She has a follow up with the dentist on Wednesday this week. In about less than one day I had felt much better! January 24 I was given an injection of antibiotics and a five-day course of Azithromycin tablets.</p>
<p>January 03 I have been taking mgs of Amoxicillin three times a day for 10 days. I'm on my third pill and starting to feel better already: December 05 Strep throat sucks. I am 35 and have never had strep before. This is very painful. I was at work in the morning and by the early evening my sore throat had progressed so much that I was nearly crying.</p>
<p>Went to the doctor a day later, assuming I had strep, he gave me a culture test, positive for strep, he gave me a script for penicillin. November 15 A one-time injection of Bicillin was an effective treatment for my strep throat. September 26 My son has strep throat and was put on amoxicillin mg twice a day. August 19 Never experience anything like this before! What the doctor prescribed for me is azithromycin.</p>
<p>It's for 5 days but keeps working days afterwards. Just want to get better. I don't have my tonsils anymore so, it's definitely been a experience I don't want to go through EVER again! July 21 I was put on amoxicillin and I was told to take Tylenol to help reduce the swelling so I could eat and drink. A clear liquid diet days course of oral broad-spectrum antibiotic. Generally, symptoms subside and disappear rapidly within hours with treatment. After a few days, the patient can start a soft, low-fiber diet and use a psyllium seed preparation for softening stools.</p>
<p>After one month, patients can be put on a high-fiber diet. Fluoroquinolones plus Metronidazole Fluoroquinolones are widely used in the treatment of diverticulitis, because of their excellent activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The duration between the last dose of last antibiotic Zinnat and the testing day is around 20 days.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, Dr. Read More As far as your genital sores are concerned however, you can be confident that this is not syphilis. On the other hand, herpes is the most common sexually acquired reason for genital ulceration.</p>
<p>If you have not had a swab test culture or PCR taken from the ulcer for diagnosis, you should. Read More So, had brief encounter with sex worker. I am a male and she a female, just for clarity and accuracy of response though I'm confident that this is irrelevant. In any case, I received oral sex lasting only a couple minutes then shortly after completed with handjob. Anyway, that night I had extreme regrets as this not something I regularly do, only once before. My daughter just come off antibotics for strep a week ago and this morning woke up with a fever of and very sore throat should she go back to doctor?</p>
<p>I listened to articles like yours for years. My son was treated psychiatricaly for 5 years while his severe bouts of ODC and aggression got worse and worse. Antibiotics brought my son back to me. Strep and various other pathogens can cause psychiatric disorders and failure to fully understand the impact something is having on an individual in favor of a generalized save money practice is irresponsible.</p>
<p>While I do agree antibiotics generally are overused, I disagree that they are overused in children with strep throat. You mention rheumatic fever and the incidence rate being low. To me a low incidence does not negate the ravaging effects of the disease should it occur. You can read about this on the NIMH website.</p>
<p>Strep can add structures molecularly to mimic cells in our body, and our body can then attack the strep and those cells for months. Regardless of the sore throat symptoms, treating strep is important to lessen the potential damage it can do. Sure we want that sore throat to lessen for their comfort, but most importantly we want to limit disease spread and time strep is in the body.</p>
<p>A child on antibiotics for 24hrs is less likely to give strep to someone else, and possibly not contagious at all. Provided the child feels better they miss less school and pass the illness to fewer people. Sir, your article is full of seemingly accurate facts and statistics.</p>
<p>Your argument is logical. But children especially mine are not faceless numbers in a statistic. Irreversible heart damage, or other potential damaged organs, that could handicap a child for the rest of their life, is not acceptable even by the tiniest margin. Yes, of course there are less cases due to diligent treatment of strep throat.</p>
<p>I also agree that there are physicians who overall are not careful enough with antibiotics. The world will never be perfect. I find this article cold an unfeeling, like lonely numbers on a chalkboard. Please remember the heart of medicine is people. Tanya—thanks for your comment. There are very real risks to children from antibiotics, beyond creating resistance and mild diarrhea.</p>
<p>Go to the pool or the beach, and you risk drowning. Diarrhea for a day is definitely worth the risk. My uncle died from complications associated to rheumatic fever. It is not worth the risk. Now, if you chose to not treat your child, that is your business. If you child dies from it. Let me know how you feel about this then. Not treating people with antibiotics is not the answer.</p>
<p>There is an answer but that is not it. Very helpful to have my non-medical opinion confirmed by an MD. Though I will not tell my kids not to take antibiotics ever, just sparingly. I hardly ever use them myself either. I do think our area is going through a pretty serious bout of strep throat right now though, lots of people have it, unfortunately. All of you, Doctor included, should look up it is ordered that my son has and thousands of other kids. Treating for a positive strep test is very important!</p>
<p>It tends to run in families that have a history of rheumatic fever and scarlet fever. And forgot to check it before sending. I was trying to say my son has a disorder called Pandas. But there remains a lot of research to be done. We also need more data to conclude that treating strep prevents or significantly reduces the risk of these disorders. I am a 42 year-old middle school teacher and I inevitably contract strep throat with typical strep symptoms and a positive rapid test every year.</p>
<p>In the past, the urgent care physician prescribed Zithromax and the symptoms were gone the next day. The last couple of times I was treated with Penicillin. The symptoms lasted 3 to 4 additional days after the shot. It feels like I have strep again yay me and wonder about just letting my body do its thing and fight it off. I am tired of getting strep annually and some research I have found points to the ability of my body to develop an immunity if I just let my immune system fight it off.</p>
<p>Is it possible to develop an immunity to Group A strep?</p></p>
