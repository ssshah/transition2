		<p><p>Acetaminophen is a less potent pain reliever that increases the effects of codeine. Acetaminophen and codeine is a combination medicine used to relieve moderate to severe pain. Acetaminophen and codeine may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide. You should not use this medicine if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or other narcotic medications. This medicine is not for use in children younger than 12 years old, and is not for use in anyone under 18 who recently had surgery to remove the tonsils or adenoids.</p>
<p>Taking this medicine during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Vomiting should be induced mechanically, or with syrup of ipecac , if the patient is alert adequate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes. The first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic.</p>
<p>If repeated doses are used, the cathartic might be included with alternate doses as required. Hypotension is usually hypovolemic and should respond to fluids. Vasopressors and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. A cuffed endo-tracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the unconscious patient and, when necessary, to provide assisted respiration.</p>
<p>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation. In severe cases of intoxication, peritoneal dialysis , or preferably hemodialysis , may be considered.</p>
<p>If hypoprothrombinemia occurs due to acetaminophen overdose, vitamin K should be administered intravenously. Naloxone , a narcotic antagonist , can reverse respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose. Since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration.</p>
<p>A narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained, since levels four or more hours following ingestion help predict acetaminophen toxicity. Do not await acetaminophen assay results before initiating treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be obtained initially, and repeated at hour intervals. Toxic Doses for adults Acetaminophen: Pharmacokinetics The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p>
<p>Codeine Codeine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body tissues, with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver , spleen and kidney. Also, other medications can affect the removal of codeine from your body, which may affect how codeine works. Be sure you know how to take this medication and what other drugs you should avoid taking with it.</p>
<p>See also Drug Interactions section. Get medical help right away if any of these very serious side effects occur: Keep this medicine in a safe place to prevent theft, misuse, or abuse. If someone accidentally swallows this drug, get medical help right away. If you have kidney disease or reduced kidney function, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen can cause decreased liver function. If you have liver disease or reduced liver function, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.</p>
<p>Taking too much acetaminophen with codeine may cause liver problems. If you experience symptoms of liver problems such as fatigue, feeling unwell, loss of appetite, nausea, yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain or swelling, and itchy skin, contact your doctor immediately.</p>
<p>If you are about to undergo surgery of the biliary tract, approach taking codeine with caution, as it may worsen your condition. Codeine will worsen the effects of acute alcohol intoxication and delirium tremens. As well, if you have low thyroid hypothyroidism , Addison's disease, benign prostatic hypertrophy enlarged prostate , gallbladder disease, urethral stricture, decreased function of the adrenal glands, or porphyria, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.</p>

They don't have any outlets. They can't sit and stare at an ant hill and see the wonder of the ants carrying in bits of grass or what ever.</p>
<p>Everything is so organised, and that makes it stressful. Also the parents have to have money now, and there are so many laws that didn't exist.
