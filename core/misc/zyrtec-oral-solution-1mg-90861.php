		<p><p>In general, the mg dose was more effective than the 5-mg dose and the mg dose gave no added effect. Some of these trials included pediatric patients aged 12 to 16 years. In addition, four multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 2 to 4 week trials in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis were conducted in the United States at doses up to 10 mg.</p>
<p>Cetirizine hydrochloride is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with perennial allergic rhinitis due to allergens such as dust mites, animal dander and molds in children 6 to 23 months of age. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, postnasal discharge, nasal pruritus, ocular pruritus, and tearing. Cetirizine hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria in children 6 months to 5 years of age.</p>
<p>It significantly reduces the occurrence, severity, and duration of hives and significantly reduces pruritus. Contraindications Cetirizine hydrochloride is contraindicated in those patients with a known hypersensitivity to it or any of its ingredients or hydroxyzine.</p>
<p>Precautions Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking cetirizine hydrochloride; due caution should therefore be exercised when driving a car or operating potentially dangerous machinery. Concurrent use of cetirizine hydrochloride with alcohol or other CNS depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of CNS performance may occur.</p>
<p>No clinically significant drug interactions have been found with theophylline at a low dose, azithromycin, pseudoephedrine, ketoconazole, or erythromycin. There was a small decrease in the clearance of cetirizine caused by a mg dose of theophylline; it is possible that larger theophylline doses could have a greater effect. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of cetirizine hydrochloride is not known.</p>
<p>Cetirizine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, and not clastogenic in the human lymphocyte assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, and in vivo micronucleus test in rats. The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride has been demonstrated in patients aged 2 to 5 years in placebo-controlled trials of up to 4 weeks duration. The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride in patients aged 12 to 24 months has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled month trial, in which the average dose was 0.</p>
<p>The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated in 42 patients aged 6 to 11 months in a placebo-controlled 7-day trial. The prescribed dose was 0. Efficacy is extrapolated down to 6 months of age for perennial allergic rhinitis because this disease is thought to occur down to these ages in children.</p>
<p>The recommended doses for the pediatric population are based on cross-study comparisons of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cetirizine in adult and pediatric subjects and on the safety profile of cetirizine in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended doses.</p>
<p>The cetirizine AUC and Cmax in pediatric subjects aged 6 to 23 months who received a mean of 2. The safety and effectiveness of cetirizine hydrochloride in pediatric patients under the age of 6 months have not been established. Adverse Reactions Pediatric studies were conducted with cetirizine hydrochloride. More than pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with more than treated with cetirizine hydrochloride at doses of 1.</p>
<p>The duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. Placebo-controlled trials up to 4 weeks duration included pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years who received cetirizine, the majority of whom received single daily doses of 5 mg. A placebo-controlled trial 18 months in duration included patients aged 12 to 24 months treated with cetirizine 0. Dosage Children aged between 2 and 6 years - Take 2.</p>
<p>Adults and children 6 years of age or older - Take 5ml 1 spoonful twice daily or 10ml 2 spoonfuls once daily. Zyrtec Oral Solution should not be used by children under 2 years of age unless otherwise advised by your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>The effects of Zrytec will not last as long in children as they do in adults so it is recommended that you split the dosage into two for children. Some people may find that they only require half the recommended daily dose for relief. Zyrtec can be taken at any time of the day and may work a little faster if not taken with food. If Zyrtec makes you feel drowsy then you are best to take it before going to bed at night or you can reduce the dosage by half.</p>
<p>Should overdose occur, symptomatic or supportive treatment is recommended. Gastric lavage may be considered shortly after ingestion of the drug. Cetirizine is not effectively removed by haemodialysis. Pharmacological properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihistamine for systemic use, piperazine derivatives, ATC code: R06A E07 Mechanism of action Cetirizine, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine, is a potent and selective antagonist of peripheral H1-receptors. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for other than H1-receptors.</p>
<p>Pharmacodynamic effects In addition to its anti-H1 effect, cetirizine was shown to display anti-allergic activities: Clinical efficacy and safety Studies in healthy volunteers show that cetirizine, at doses of 5 and 10 mg strongly inhibits the wheal and flare reactions induced by very high concentrations of histamine into the skin, but the correlation with efficacy is not established.</p>
<p>In a six-week, placebo-controlled study of patients with allergic rhinitis and concomitant mild to moderate asthma, cetirizine 10 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms and did not alter pulmonary function. This study supports the safety of administering cetirizine to allergic patients with mild to moderate asthma.</p></p>
