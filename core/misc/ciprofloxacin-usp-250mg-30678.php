		<p><p>This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life. On concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin and caffeine or pentoxifylline containing products, elevated serum concentrations of these xanthine derivatives were reported.</p>
<p>Histamine H 2-receptor antagonists appear to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin. Phenytoin Altered serum levels of phenytoin increased and decreased have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin. To avoid the loss of seizure control associated with decreased phenytoin levels, and to prevent phenytoin overdose-related undesirable effects when ciprofloxacin is discontinued in patients receiving both agents, monitoring of phenytoin therapy, including phenytoin serum concentration measurements, is recommended during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin with phenytoin.</p>
<p>The concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with glyburide has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Fatalities have been reported. Metronidazole The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly.</p>
<p>Cyclosporine Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly. Oral Anti-coagulants Simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulantmay augment the effect of the anticoagulant. The risk may vary with the underlying infection, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of ciprofloxacin to the increase in INR international normalized ratio is difficult to assess.</p>
<p>Prothrombin time and INR should be monitored frequently during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant for example, warfarin. Probenecid Probenecid interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in the serum.</p>
<p>This should be considered if patients are receiving both drugs concomitantly. Methotrexate Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might increase the risk of methotrexate associated toxic reactions. Therefore, patients under methotrexate therapy should be carefully monitored when concomitant ciprofloxacin therapy is indicated. Metoclopramide Metoclopramide significantly accelerates the absorption of oral ciprofloxacin resulting in shorter time to reach maximum plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>No significant effect was observed on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin. Duloxetine In clinical studies it was demonstrated that concomitant use of duloxetine with strong inhibitors of the CYP 1A2 isozyme such as fluvoxamine, may result in a 5-fold increase in mean AUC and a 2. Although no clinical data are available on a possible interaction with ciprofloxacin, similar effects can be expected upon concomitant administration.</p>
<p>NSAIDs Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but not acetyl salicylic acid in combination of very high doses of quinolones have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre-clinical studies.</p>
<p>Monitoring for ropinirole-related side effects and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin. Lidocaine In a study conducted in 9 healthy volunteers, concomitant use of 1.</p>
<p>Although lidocaine treatment was well tolerated at this elevated exposure, a possible interaction with ciprofloxacin and an increase in side effects related to lidocaine may occur upon concomitant administration. Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse effects and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin are advised.</p>
<p>Sildenafil Following concomitant administration of a single oral dose of 50 mg sildenafil with mg ciprofloxacin to healthy subjects, the mean Cmax and mean AUC of sildenafil were both increased approximately two-fold. Therefore, sildenafil should be used with caution when co-administered with ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Eight in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with ciprofloxacin, and the test results are listed below: Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate that ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control. Hairless Skh-1 mice were exposed to UVA light for 3. The times to development of skin tumors ranged from 16 - 32 weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and other quinolones.</p>
<p>The clinical significance of these findings to humans is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The reported rates of major congenital malformations were 2. Rates of spontaneous abortions, prematurity and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children. The malformation rates among live-born babies exposed to ciprofloxacin and to fluoroquinolones overall were both within background incidence ranges.</p>
<p>No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The study did not reveal any clear adverse reactions due to in utero exposure to ciprofloxacin. No differences in the rates of prematurity, spontaneous abortions, or birth weight were seen in women exposed to ciprofloxacin during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk. The amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed by the nursing infant is unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants nursing from mothers taking ciprofloxacin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use Ciprofloxacin, like other quinolones, causes arthropathy and histological changes in weight-bearing joints of juvenile animals resulting in lameness.</p>
<p>Inhalational Anthrax Post-Exposure Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients for inhalational anthrax post-exposure. The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate. Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis Ciprofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli. The rates of these events in pediatric patients with complicated urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis within six weeks of follow-up were 9.</p>
<p>The rates of these events occurring at any time up to the one year follow-up were  Cystic Fibrosis Short-term safety data from a single trial in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients are available. Patients less than 5 years of age were not studied. Safety monitoring in the study included periodic range of motion examinations and gait assessments by treatment-blinded examiners. Patients were followed for an average of 23 days after completing treatment range days.</p>
<p>This study was not designed to determine long term effects and the safety of repeated exposure to ciprofloxacin. Other adverse events were similar in nature and frequency between treatment arms. One of sixty-seven patients developed arthritis of the knee nine days after a ten-day course of treatment with ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>Clinical symptoms resolved, but an MRI showed knee effusion without other abnormalities eight months after treatment. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients ages 5—17 years , 67 patients received Ciprofloxacin I.</p>
<p>Patients were followed for an average of 23 days after completing treatment range 0—93 days. Geriatric Use Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.</p>
<p>No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.</p>
<p>Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia. Most of the adverse events reported were described as only mild or moderate in severity, abated soon after the drug was discontinued, and required no treatment.</p>
<p>The most frequently reported drug related events, from clinical trials of all formulations, all dosages, all drug-therapy durations, and for all indications of ciprofloxacin therapy were nausea 2.</p>
<p>Body as a Whole: The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. In patients with severe infections and severe renal impairment, a unit dose of mg may be administered at the intervals noted above.</p>
<p>Patients should be carefully monitored. Pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were excluded from the clinical trial of cUTI and pyelonephritis.</p>
<p>With Dairy Products Concomitant administration of Ciprofloxacin tablets with dairy products like milk or yogurt or calcium-fortified juices alone should be avoided since decreased absorption is possible; however, Ciprofloxacin tablets may be taken with a meal that contains these products. Hydration of Patients Receiving Ciprofloxacin Tablets Assure adequate hydration of patients receiving Ciprofloxacin tablets to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine.</p>
<p>Crystalluria has been reported with quinolones. Instruct the patient of the appropriate Ciprofloxacin tablets administration [see Patient Counseling Information 17 ]. Warnings and Precautions 5. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion.</p>
<p>These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting Ciprofloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including Ciprofloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses.</p>
<p>A study performed using an Italian healthcare database reached qualitatively similar conclusions. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold, and may cause other central nervous system side effects.</p>
<p>Headache, dizziness, and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in postapproval review articles, along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS side effects such as tremors, psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicide attempts, especially at higher doses. Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control. Other[ edit ] The other black box warning is that ciprofloxacin should not be used in people with myasthenia gravis due to possible exacerbation of muscle weakness which may lead to breathing problems resulting in death or ventilator support.</p>
<p>Fluoroquinolones are known to block neuromuscular transmission. FDA or the subject of case reports published in medical journals includes, but is not limited to, toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens-Johnson syndrome , abnormal heart rhythms torsades de pointes or QT prolongation , low blood pressure, allergic pneumonitis, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis or liver failure, and sensitivity to light.</p>
<p>Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach by induced vomiting or gastric lavage , as well as administration of antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, or calcium to reduce drug absorption. Renal function and urinary pH should be monitored. Important support includes adequate hydration and urine acidification if necessary to prevent crystalluria. Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs sevelamer , lanthanum carbonate , sucralfate , didanosine , or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc.</p>
<p>It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal. CYP1A2 substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin-treated patients include tizanidine , theophylline , caffeine , methylxanthines , clozapine , olanzapine , and ropinirole.</p>
<p>Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index. The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake. Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP1A2 substrates such as cyclosporine is equivocal or conflicting.</p>
<p>It is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Pharmacokinetics[ edit ] Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous administration. When administered over one hour as an intravenous infusion, [26] ciprofloxacin rapidly distributes into the tissues, with levels in some tissues exceeding those in the serum.</p>
<p>Urinary excretion is virtually complete 24 hours after administration.</p></p>
