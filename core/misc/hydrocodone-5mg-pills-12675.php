		<p><p>Hope this can help clear up at least some misconceptions. Why do we need alternative opioids? Morphine also acts as a "depressant" on the system whereas Oxycodone and Hydrocodone act as "stimulants", both situations being main categories for misunderstandings and false pre-tenses when giving information to patients or colleagues as to which opiate is "better". Ultimately, the facts remain that Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic medication synthesized from opium-derived thebaine.</p>
<p>Thebaine paramorphine is an opiate alkaloid. A minor constituent of opium, thebaine is chemically similar to both morphine and codeine, but has stimulatory rather than depressant effects, causing convulsions similar to strychnine poisoning at higher doses.</p>
<p>Pethidine Demerol may be more likely to be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, hydromorphone, and placebo, pethidine was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance when administered to healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids — serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor — are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. The toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored.</p>
<p>Addiction is diagnosed on a spectrum from mild to severe. Some signs of hydrocodone addiction include taking more than intending to and prioritizing drug use over personal or professional responsibilities. Addictions to hydrocodone, Vicodin, Norco and Lortab can spiral out of control quickly. Get help for a hydrocodone addiction now. Hydrocodone and Other Drugs Abusing hydrocodone alongside other drugs can increase the likelihood of negative effects or overdose.</p>
<p>Mixing hydrocodone with alcohol can be especially dangerous, as both substances are central nervous system depressants. In some cases, combined hydrocodone and alcohol abuse can lead to respiratory failure. All too often, people who have developed a dependence on hydrocodone while prescribed to it turn to heroin as a substitute afterward.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone Abuse Statistics Prescription opioids such as hydrocodone are the fourth most common addiction in the U. Treating a Hydrocodone Addiction Hydrocodone powerfully addictive. Medical detox and a professional treatment program make it easier to break this addiction. Abuse and Dependence Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of narcotics; therefore, this product should be prescribed and administered with caution.</p>
<p>Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued narcotic use, although some mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of narcotic therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia , is manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia.</p>
<p>The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing.</p>
<p>Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. Acute Abdominal Conditions The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p>
<p>The usual precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether hydrocodone or acetaminophen have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis , or impairment of fertility.</p>
<p>Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nonteratogenic Effects Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate , increased stools, sneezing, yawning , vomiting and fever.</p>
<p>The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. There is no consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal. Labor And Delivery As with all narcotics, administration of this product to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used. Nursing Mothers Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known.</p>
<p>It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>
<p>Geriatric Use Clinical studies of hydrocodone bitartrate 5 mg and acetaminophen mg did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p></p>
