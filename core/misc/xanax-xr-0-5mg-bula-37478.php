		<p><p>If you are using the oral liquid, measure the dose with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Dosing TOP The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label.</p>
<p>The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p>
<p>For oral dosage forms solution, tablets, or orally disintegrating tablets: Your doctor may increase your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 4 mg per day. Older adults—At first, 0. Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor. For oral dosage form extended-release tablets: However, the dose is usually not more than 10 mg per day. Signs and symptoms of withdrawal are often more prominent after rapid decrease of dosage or abrupt discontinuance.</p>
<p>Patients, especially individuals with a history of seizures or epilepsy , should not be abruptly discontinued from any CNS depressant agent, including alprazolam. Psychological dependence is a risk with all benzodiazepines, including alprazolam. Some patients have experienced considerable difficulty in tapering and discontinuing from alprazolam, especially those receiving higher doses for extended periods.</p>
<p>Addiction- prone individuals should be under careful surveillance when receiving alprazolam. As with all anxiolytics, repeat prescriptions should be limited to those who are under medical supervision.</p>
<p>These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms ; the most important is seizure see Drug Abuse And Dependence. However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients who received XANAX Tablets, the duration of treatment 3 months compared to 6 months had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. Relapse or return of illness was defined as a return of symptoms characteristic of panic disorder primarily panic attacks to levels approximately equal to those seen at baseline before active treatment was initiated.</p>
<p>Rebound refers to a return of symptoms of panic disorder to a level substantially greater in frequency, or more severe in intensity than seen at baseline. Withdrawal symptoms were identified as those which were generally not characteristic of panic disorder and which occurred for the first time more frequently during discontinuation than at baseline. Experience in randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation studies of patients with panic disorder who received XANAX Tablets showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo treated patients.</p>
<p>In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to XANAX Tablets and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.</p>
<p>In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients treated with XANAX Tablets, the duration of treatment 3 months compared to 6 months had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. All three patients recovered without sequelae. Seizures have also been observed in association with dose reduction or discontinuation of XANAX Tablets, the immediate release form of alprazolam.</p>
<p>Five of these cases clearly occurred during abrupt dose reduction, or discontinuation from daily doses of 2 to 10 mg. Three cases occurred in situations where there was not a clear relationship to abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation. In one instance, seizure occurred after discontinuation from a single dose of 1 mg after tapering at a rate of 1 mg every three days from 6 mg daily.</p>
<p>In two other instances, the relationship to taper is indeterminate; in both of these cases the patients had been receiving doses of 3 mg daily prior to seizure. The duration of use in the above 8 cases ranged from 4 to 22 weeks. There have been occasional voluntary reports of patients developing seizures while apparently tapering gradually from XANAX. Status Epilepticus The medical event voluntary reporting system shows that withdrawal seizures have been reported in association with the discontinuation of XANAX Tablets.</p>
<p>In most cases, only a single seizure was reported; however, multiple seizures and status epilepticus were reported as well. Thus, the physician who elects to use this drug for periods longer than 8 weeks should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p>
<p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe XANAX XR concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p>
<p>In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of XANAX XR than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking XANAX XR, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.</p>
<p>Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined see Drug Interactions. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions, Including Seizures Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam.</p>
<p>However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients who received XANAX Tablets, the duration of treatment 3 months compared to 6 months had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose.

<p>In most cases, only a single seizure was reported; however, multiple seizures and status epilepticus were reported as well. Interdose Symptoms Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of XANAX Tablets have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose.</p>
<p>In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound, or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval.</p></p>
