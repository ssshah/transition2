		<p><p>It works by reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein LDL or "bad" cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, while increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein HDL or "good" cholesterol. Common side effects of Crestor include weakness, dizziness, mild nausea, mild abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, memory problems, and headache. More serious side effects can occur. Some people taking Crestor have experienced a rare, but serious side effect called rhabdomyolysis.</p>
<p>This side effect is a breakdown of muscle tissue that can result in kidney failure. It is more likely to occur in people over the age of 65 years or who already have kidney problems. Stop using Crestor and contact your doctor right away if you have any signs of rhabdomyolysis including unexplained muscle pain or tenderness, muscle weakness, fever or flu symptoms, and dark colored urine.</p>
<p>Your doctor can determine if it is safe to continue taking Crestor. This is not a complete list of side effects that can occur with Crestor. Your doctor or health care provider is best able to properly evaluate your medical condition and make recommendations based on your specific circumstances.</p>
<p>If Crestor is causing the leg cramps then what health problem can that cause? Crestor rosuvastatin is a medication used to lower bad cholesterol and to raise good cholesterol. However, it can cause a side effect of leg cramps.</p>
<p>This side effect will require a doctor to access if it is a symptom of rhabdomyolysis, which is when the muscle fibers break down. When the muscle fibers break down, the contents can be sent to the kidney and possibly cause damage. If you have leg cramps, your doctor can change this medication to a different one to manage your cholesterol. Other side effects may include weakness, dizziness, mild nausea, constipation, diarrhea, sore throat, runny nose, memory loss, headache, or pain or burning when you urinate.</p>
<p>Patti Brown, PharmD Q: What are some side effects of taking Crestor? Crestor rosuvastatin is a medication that is used to treat high cholesterol and triglycerides. It is in a group of medications called statins, and works by blocking the ability of a naturally occurring enzyme to produce cholesterol in the liver.</p>
<p>The prescribing information for Crestor lists the following as common side effects of the medication: These could be signs of a rare, but serious, side effect. I started taking Crestor about 6 months ago. My doctor switched me from Lipitor. Lately I have experienced leg pain similar to sore muscles after prolonged or new exercise. I did not experience the same issue after using Lipitor for more than 6 years.</p>
<p>Is there any way to know if this is caused by the medicine? Sure there is a way to find out if the new medication, Crestor, is causing your pain. The best way to find out is to discontinue the Crestor and go back to the Lipitor. If the pain does not return after switching back to Lipitor, you can probably be sure that it was the Crestor that was the source of the pain. Of course you will need to speak with your physician first. Crestor rosuvastatin is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent.</p>
<p>The most common side effects are headache, myalgia muscle pain , abdominal pain, asthenia loss or lack of bodily strength; weakness and nausea. And other side effects include, stomach upset, heartburn, constipation, bloating and gas.</p>
<p>Lipitor atorvastatin is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. The most common side effects are muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with fever or flu symptoms; or nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite. And other side effects include mild nausea or stomach pain, stomach upset, heartburn, constipation, bloating, gas. This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with Lipitor and Crestor.</p>
<p>For more specific information, consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. What are the side effects of taking Crestor for high cholesterol? This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with Crestor. Always keep a current list of the drugs and supplements you take and review it with your healthcare providers and your pharmacist. What, if any, are the correlations between Crestor and type 2 diabetes?</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer's package insert for Crestor rosuvastatin , there is no correlation between type 2 diabetes and Crestor, per se. There is however a syndrome that was originally described in as "syndrome X" or "metabolic syndrome," and it is a group of common health disorders occurring together, including insulin resistance, hypertension, abdominal obesity, reduced HDL-cholesterol levels, and elevated triglycerides.</p>
<p>And Crestor works by reducing levels of "bad" cholesterol low-density lipoprotein, or LDL and triglycerides in the blood, while increasing levels of "good" cholesterol high-density lipoprotein, or HDL.</p>
<p>William Gault, RPh Q: I have been having back pain since I started Crestor, is this a side effect? Crestor rosuvastatin is a statin medication used to treat high cholesterol. The most common side effects with Crestor are muscle pain, constipation and sore throat.</p>
<p>Other side effects with Crestor include joint pain, and weakness This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with Crestor. Laura Cable, PharmD Q: I am taking Crestor for my cholesterol and my leg hurts. Can taking Crestor do this? According to drug information, Crestor rosuvastatin has reported adverse reactions of both myalgia and arthralgia. Please talk to your health care provider, immediately, about your leg pain.</p>
<p>I was prescribed Crestor 10 mg for high cholesterol and after 10 days I was in such pain I returned to the doctor who said I now had polymyalgia rheumatica. I am a 52 year old female and now on steroids. Can you tell me why the statin brought on this condition? Polymyalgia rheumatica PMR is an inflammatory disorder involving pain and stiffness in the hip or shoulder area. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disorder that almost always occurs in people over 50 years old.</p>
<p>The cause is unknown. Although symptoms are located mainly in the muscles and there are no outward signs of arthritis, in some cases there is evidence of inflammatory arthritis.</p>
<p>The most common symptoms in PMR are pain and stiffness in various muscles, fatigue, a general feeling of ill health, mild fever on and off, loss of appetite and anemia low hemoglobin level. The standard treatment is with pain medications like ibuprofen and with steroids to decrease the inflammation.</p>
<p>PMR often regresses spontaneously in 1 to 2 years. Lifestyle changes like regular exercise and a good diet is important. It doesn't seem, from drug information resources, that Crestor actually caused the problem, but it may have contributed in bringing it to the surface because of the usual side effect of causing muscle pain or weakness. Because statins can affect the muscles, it may have aggravated the underlying problem making you aware that something was wrong.</p>
<p>I am 56 years old and in menopause. I have been taking Crestor 20 mg for more than 3 years. That is an unusual drop in HDL, especially being on Crestor at the same time. You did not state over what time period this drop occurred, and it is not clear what other factors may be contributing to your health status. Proper diet and regular exercise are of course, very important in maintaining good cholesterol levels. It is not clear if you have had any unusual change in your diet or exercise regimen.</p>
<p>Can Crestor cause back pain and joint pain in the hips and knees? Crestor rosuvastatin , as well as other statin medications, has a small risk of rhabdomyolysis, the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle. Since its introduction, I have had a number of patients taking Crestor that have had the same symptoms you have. This condition was cleared by switching to another statin.</p>
<p>Consult with your physician regarding this. Joseph Hall, RPh Q: Can I cut my mg Crestor in half? My doctor decreased my dose to 10 mg. Crestor is one of the medications that is able to be cut in half. Many medications are not able to be cut due to extended release properties or distribution of the drug in the pill.</p>
<p>However, Crestor is okay to be split as long as the tablet is cut into equal parts. This may be easier to do with a pill cutter since the tablet is not scored. Is there an alternative to Crestor that will not upset my stomach?</p>
<p>Crestor rosuvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, more commonly referred to as "statins. Crestor lowers low-density lipoprotein LDL or "bad" cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing high-density lipoprotein HDL or "good" cholesterol. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.</p>
<p>If you are more than 12 hours late, skip the missed dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. What happens if I overdose? Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at  What should I avoid while taking Crestor? It can raise triglyceride levels and may increase your risk of liver damage. Avoid using antacids without your doctor's advice. Use only the type of antacid your doctor recommends, and do not take it within 2 hours after taking Crestor.</p>
<p>Some antacids can make it harder for your body to absorb rosuvastatin. Avoid eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol. Crestor will not be as effective in lowering your cholesterol if you do not follow a cholesterol-lowering diet plan. Crestor side effects Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction to Crestor: I have stents but they could not stent the heart attack area.</p>
<p>They could not by-pass it either. I am on Zebeta worked better for me than Coreg and an ace inhibitor. Read More I am basically disabled by this 10 weeks and have lost 20 pounds. I have had normal MRI's and Brain scan, normal nerve conduction and muscle tests but 3 weeks ago and my symptoms are more severe now -and normal blood tests I have seen a rheumatologist but he says that my symptoms don't match Lupus exactly.</p>
<p>What could this be? Who do I see? Read More recovering heroin addict with an unquenchable thirst for cheap wine and anything else with alcohol in it. Read More You may have to go on a drug such as Crestor or one of the other statin drugs to get your triglycerides down and raise your HDL. After they get your LDL and cholesterol up and triglycerides down or find out the reason for this then you can change your diet and I would recommend a vegan diet without added oil.</p>
<p>Read More Overtime the liver may be able to regain some function with careful diet and exercise as tolerated and avoidance of all unnecessary chemicals that have to be cleared by the liver.</p>
<p>This means no alcohol , care with prescription and OTC medicine and all other chemicals. Note THC the active ingredient in marihuana is a chemical that your liver needs to process. Save your money don't spend it on snake oil but on healthy food. There are no easy answers no magic cures. I don't take any medication, my heart has been cleared as good. Yes, its annoying at nite when your trying to sleep, my bed use to shake ever so slightly sometimes because of it.</p>
<p>Read More I have read with interest all the comments about probable kidney pain early in the morning. I am 45 and first had this pain 20 years ago after a night of drinking heavily - pain both sides in the kidney area which went soon after getting out of bed. The doctor put it down to muscle pain due to being in a 'comatose' state. I have experienced it a few times over the ensuing years - always after drinking a bit too much alcohol.</p>
<p>Crestor is a drug belonging to the statin group, and is a chemical compound. Any chemical compound that is consumed is dealt within the body by your Liver. Liver is the major organ which helps in the excretion of the metabolic wastes. If you are a heavy alcohol drinker then your liver may not be functioning optimally. In such a case whatever crestor you consume, gets piling in the blood, without getting excreted out due to incompetence of your weak or damaged liver.</p>
<p>Such huge build up of crestor levels in blood is a sure ticket to danger. So it is better to avoid combining crestor and alcohol together, especially when you drink a lot of alcohol What other things can harm your Liver? It is not always alcohol alone that damages your liver.</p></p>
