		<p><p>Thatl drop you to sleep and have you feelin nice doin it haha. This renders your OP pointless. This is what I think. Thatl smash you He said Depakote. This post is entirely useless.</p>
<p>Not trying to offend you. Useless in regards to OP. My point is an anti psych can do something. We won't say it again. Quetiapine is just about the most shitty feeling "intoxication" that there is.</p>
<p>Divalproex Sodium is NOT a recreational drug for starters next there is no way we can explain if effects you got are placebo or not, all we can do is speculate. Have you ever smoked something and gotten high before?</p>
<p>You can take Depakote with Tramadol as long as you don't exceed more than 3 a day. I am on both meds and the pharamists told me that and I have lived by it, and I have not had seizures but then again I am taking Depakote for BiPolar Disorder not epilepsy. Does Depakote treat depression?</p>
<p>Yes, Depakote can be used to treat depression and other mooddisorders. It is also prescribed to some people to treat seizuresand migraine headaches. Does depakote show on a drug test? It depends on the drug test. Tests depend on the number of drugs they test. They range anywhere from a five drug panel usually amphetamines, cannabinoids marijuana , cocaine, opiates, and cyclics phencyclidines to up to 20 or more.</p>
<p>Either way, if you have a valid prescription for the drug, the testing forms usually ask what medications you are currently taking ITS not a narcotic. Nothing to test for. Are there and interactions between Xanax and depakote? I take both Xanax and Depakote. I have been taking Depakote for 7 months and I just started taking Xanax with it. I also take an anti-depressant. I already am noticing that the Xanax trumps it all!</p>
<p>I think I will stop taking my Depakote and take my Xanax and anti-depressant. I never liked Depakote because I get extremely fatiqued while on it and I really do not know what the hell it is doing to me anyways.</p>
<p>In my case I feel so bad that I do not care about addiction right now and I just want to feel normal. Xanax I feel was made for some and not others. If you experience so much anxiety that it makes you break down and cry, then I suggest Xanax. Forget what people say and if it helps that is all that matters. Depression and anxiety are nothing to mess around with.</p>
<p>I hope this helped. Can you eat grapefruit when taking Depakote? Can you drink alcohol and take depakote? Your information from the pharmacy should have included a warning against drinking alcohol while taking Depakote.</p>
<p>They are the same. Enteric coated EC divalproaex pills are delayed release DR. Can depakote be crushed? No form of Depakote can be crushed. If a patient can not take pills whole you would want to see if the MD would switch the patient to Depakote Sprinkles that can be mixed in with food or to the liquids form What is the Difference bewtwwen Depakote ER and Depakote DR? Depakote ER is an extended release pill, meaning you should only have to take it once a day, versus, Depakote DR which is delayed release and taken multiple times a day.</p>
<p>Delayed release is a coated pill that all medication is released when the coating dissolves. The coating helps reduce upset stomach that can be experienced with the regular Depakote. Does a daily dose of mg Depakote seem high for an 8 year old boy? It's impossible to answer your question accurately without first getting more background information on the patient. Is he being treated for mania,epilepsy,migraines or something else?</p>
<p>Also how much does the child weigh? Dosages vary depending upon the condition being treated and by taking into consideration the weight of the patient. Kim Is depakote a benzo? Depakote is an anti-convulsant, most often used in cases of epilepsy. It is also used, off label, for bipolar disorder and is sometimes prescribed for nervous system disorders.</p>
<p>Depakote and ringing in the ears? Ringing in the ears is a side effect to depakote. If it is constant and interfering with your life, then you should really consider switching medications. There are better ones out there. Is mg day too high for depakote? My son is on mg of depakote er. His doctor has him check his blood levels and he needs this high dose for the medication to be effective. It has changed his life for the better.</p>
<p>The only problem is significant weight gain. Hopefully they will come up with something in the future to help with this. How often to draw a depakote level? Every couple months or so would be good. The psychiatrist will usually tell you when to check the level though. What are the long term effects of depakote? Depakote makes you crave carbs, so it is very likely for you to gain a lot of weight. When I was on depakote, over time, they had to keep raising the dose more and more.</p>
<p>So I went off that medication. Is depakote bad for the liver? I started having seizures in at the age of 15 and went through so many different medications.</p>
<p>Of course Depakote was the only medication strong enough to "control" my seizures or decrease the number I was having daily and weekly anyways; however, Depakote is valporic acid which is hard for your liver to break down so that is why you have to have liver function tests done every so often. I have mine done every 3 months when I go to get my refills. Can you take depakote and Lortabs together? I have been on Depakote since i was 15 for grand-mal seizures and have had to take Lortab for numberous things like toothaches, headaches and broken bones.</p>
<p>I would still consult my doctor first, but you shouldn't have any problems. Why is Depakote taken at night? It is not always taken at night. Some people take it in the morning, or if taking a non-extended release form, twice per day. Depakote divalproex is an anticonvulsant and antimanic agent. Depakote may be used to prevent seizures, treat bipolar disorder or prevent migraines.</p>
<p>The most common side effects with Depakote are headache, change in appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, hair loss, nausea, insomnia, weight changes.</p>
<p>Other side effects with Depakote include nervousness, pain, vomiting, tremor, and flu-like symptoms. This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with Depakote. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action.</p>
<p>When your doctor prescribes a new medication, be sure to discuss all your prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including dietary supplements, vitamins, botanicals, minerals, and herbals, as well as the foods you eat. Always keep a current list of the drugs and supplements you take and review it with your health care providers and your pharmacist. If possible, use one pharmacy for all your prescription medications and over-the-counter products. This allows your pharmacist to keep a complete record of all your prescription drugs and to advise you about drug interactions and side effects.</p>
<p>Tell your health care provider about any negative side effects from prescription drugs. You can also report them to the U. Food and Drug Administration by visiting www. Laura Cable, PharmD Q: Depakote is used as therapy for seizures and also for behavioral issues related to bipolar disorder. Other side effects include drowsiness, weight changes, unusual taste, diarrhea and upset stomach.</p>
<p>I take generic Depakote mg at night for bipolar disorder. Does this influence my libido performance? For more information regarding Depakote or bipolar disorder: My husband has been prescribed Depakote and he is not taking it properly. He's recently had a problem with not being able to sleep at night, feels extremely sluggish in the morning, and has anger outbursts. Severe drowsiness is a side effect of Depakote. The medication comes in an extended release form. If this is not what your husband is taking, perhaps the physician will switch to this.</p>
<p>This would level out the blood level concentrations. There have been no documented reports of anger outbursts. For any immediate concerns, consult your physician. For more information, there are several articles on Depakote: How does Depakote affect bone density? Some people who have taken Depakote divalproex sodium for many years have experienced some bone loss.</p>
<p>Taking both calcium and vitamin D may help to prevent this kind of problem. Doctors often recommend a bone density test to identify which people need treatment for bone loss.</p>
<p>This is not a common reaction. Side effects tend to be patient-specific so check with your doctor for further evaluation if this continues to be a concern. I take Tegretol and Depakote for epilepsy. I know these medicines deplete some of my vitamin absorption. Is a multivitamin still enough, or should I take more of certain things? According to Lexi-Comp, it is recommended that you drink adequate amounts of water while taking Tegretol, and grapefruit juice should be avoided.</p>
<p>Tegretol has a possible adverse reaction of causing hyponatremia, which means there is a decrease in the amount of salt in the body fluids. According to research articles, biotin can also be depleted by anti-seizure medications.</p>
<p>Antiepileptic medications have also shown to lower folate levels. Research also speculates a decrease in inositol from Depakote. There could be other issues, too. The recommendation is to talk with your health care provider to determine if any additional vitamins should be taken beyond a multivitamin. Your health care provider could perform lab work to check for deficiencies. As always, talk with your health care provider about your medication questions.</p></p>
