		<p><p>Since diabetes is frequently complicated by renal disease, consider a lower starting dose and gradual increase in dose for patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration 2. Begin treatment at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily.</p>
<p>Some patients may respond to the starting dose. Begin treatment at 30 mg for one week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily. There is no evidence that higher doses confer additional benefit, even in patients who do not respond to a 60 mg dose, and higher doses are associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies  Dosing in Special Populations Hepatic Impairment â€” Avoid use in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Warnings and Precautions 5. Caution patients to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms. This may need to be treated in a hospital and may be life-threatening. Activation of Mania or Hypomania - Adequately screen patients with depressive symptoms for risk of bipolar disorder e. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy.</p>
<p>Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle-closure, and have a prophylactic procedure e. Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers Advise patients to notify their physician if they: Interference with Psychomotor Performance - Any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills.</p>
<p>Although in controlled studies CYMBALTA has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, cognitive function, or memory, it may be associated with sedation and dizziness. Therefore, caution patients about operating hazardous machinery including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that CYMBALTA therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.</p>
<p>Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis Duloxetine was administered in the diet to mice and rats for 2 years.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis Duloxetine was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay Ames test and was not clastogenic in an in vivo chromosomal aberration test in mouse bone marrow cells. Additionally, duloxetine was not genotoxic in an in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells or in an in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis UDS assay in primary rat hepatocytes, and did not induce sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster bone marrow in vivo.</p>
<p>When duloxetine was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout gestation and lactation, pup weights at birth and pup survival to 1 day postpartum were decreased at a dose 2 times the MRHD. At this dose, pup behaviors consistent with increased reactivity, such as increased startle response to noise and decreased habituation of locomotor activity were observed.</p>
<p>Post-weaning growth was not adversely affected. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis , apnea , seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia , hypotonia , hypertonia , hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. Post-weaning growth and reproductive performance of the progeny were not affected adversely by maternal duloxetine treatment. The estimated daily infant dose was approximately 0.</p>
<p>The peak concentration measured in breast milk occurred at a median of 3 hours after the dose. Pediatric Use Generalized Anxiety Disorder In pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years, efficacy was demonstrated in one 10week, placebo-controlled trial. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 7 years of age have not been established.</p>
<p>Major Depressive Disorder Efficacy was not demonstrated in two week, placebo-controlled trials with pediatric patients with MDD, age 7 to  The most frequently observed adverse reactions in the clinical trials included nausea, headache, decreased weight, and abdominal pain.</p>
<p>Of the patients in CLBP premarketing studies,  Of the patients in OA premarketing studies,  Of the 1, patients in FM premarketing studies, 7.</p>
<p>In the MDD, GAD, DPNP, FM, OA, and CLBP studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were generally observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>In an analysis of data from all placebo-controlled-trials, patients treated with CYMBALTA reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo. Underlying risk appears to increase steadily with age.</p>
<p>As elderly patients tend to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for falls such as medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself on falls during treatment with CYMBALTA is unclear. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine after a single dose of 40 mg were compared in healthy elderly females 65 to 77 years and healthy middle-age females 32 to 50 years. Dosage adjustment based on the age of the patient is not necessary.</p>
<p>In the MDD, GAD, DPNP, FM, OA, and CLBP studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were generally observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>SSRIs and SNRIs, including Cymbalta have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [see Warnings and Precautions 5. In an analysis of data from all placebo-controlled-trials, patients treated with Cymbalta reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo. The increased risk appears to be proportional to a patient's underlying risk for falls. Underlying risk appears to increase steadily with age.</p>
<p>As elderly patients tend to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for falls such as medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself on falls during treatment with Cymbalta is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including bone fractures and hospitalizations have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustment based on the age of the patient is not necessary. Gender Duloxetine's half-life is similar in men and women. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not necessary. Dosage modifications are not recommended for smokers. Race No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Hepatic Impairment Patients with clinically evident hepatic impairment have decreased duloxetine metabolism and elimination. Although Cmax was similar to normals in the cirrhotic patients, the half-life was about 3 times longer [see Dosage and Administration 2.</p>
<p>The elimination half-life, however, was similar in both groups. The AUCs of the major circulating metabolites, 4-hydroxy duloxetine glucuronide and 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy duloxetine sulfate, largely excreted in urine, were approximately 7- to 9-fold higher and would be expected to increase further with multiple dosing.</p>
<p>Drug Abuse and Dependence Abuse In animal studies, duloxetine did not demonstrate barbiturate-like depressant abuse potential. While Cymbalta has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, there was no indication of drug-seeking behavior in the clinical trials. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of Cymbalta e. Dependence In drug dependence studies, duloxetine did not demonstrate dependence-producing potential in rats.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of overdose duloxetine alone or with mixed drugs included somnolence, coma, serotonin syndrome, seizures, syncope, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, and vomiting.</p>
<p>In case of acute overdose, treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdose with any drug. An adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation should be assured, and cardiac rhythm and vital signs should be monitored.</p>
<p>Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption of duloxetine from the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of activated charcoal has been shown to decrease AUC and Cmax by an average of one-third, although some subjects had a limited effect of activated charcoal.</p>
<p>Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be beneficial. In managing overdose, the possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered.</p>
<p>A review from the Annals of Internal Medicine lists duloxetine among the first line drug treatments, however, along with citalopram , escitalopram , sertraline , paroxetine , and venlafaxine. The average daily pain was measured using an point scale, and duloxetine treatment resulted in an additional 1â€”1. Most of the response was achieved in the first two weeks on the medication.</p>
<p>Duloxetine slightly increased the fasting serum glucose ; this effect was deemed to be of "minimal clinical significance", however. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants imipramine and amitriptyline , traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine.</p>
<p>Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while the opioids caused more side effects. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The authors noted that the evidence in favor of duloxetine is much more solid, however. Food and Drug Administration approved duloxetine to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain, including discomfort from osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain.</p></p>
