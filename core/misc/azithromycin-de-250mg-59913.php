            <h1>Azithromycin de 250mg - Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Your doctor will tell you if you need to take another dose. Do not take another dose unless your doctor tells you to do so. You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with azithromycin. If your symptoms do not improve, or get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Take azithromycin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking azithromycin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Other uses for this medicine Azithromycin is also used sometimes to treat H.</p>
<p>It is also used to prevent heart infection in people having dental or other procedures, and to prevent STD in victims of sexual assault. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.</p>
<p>This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow? Before taking azithromycin, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to azithromycin, clarithromycin Biaxin, in Prevpac , dirithromycin not available in the U. Studies have shown that antibiotics such as azithromycin Zithromax, Zmax may decrease hormonal birth control efficacy. There is more evidence of this with tetracycline and ampicillin.</p>
<p>Use caution when taking these two medications at the same time. Lowell Sterler, RPh Q: Can both women and men take azithromycin suspension? Azithromycin is approved, by the U. Food and Drug Administration FDA , as a safe and effective treatment, for men and women, to treat various different types of bacterial infections, such as respiratory infections, skin infections, ear infections and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Azithromycin should be taken exactly as directed by your health care provider. The dose and duration of treatment with azithromycin suspension differs depending on the type of infection being treated. According to the prescribing information, the most commonly reported side effects associated with treatment with azithromycin include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and vaginitis. Azithromycin should only be taken as prescribed by your health care provider.</p>
<p>For more information regarding azithromycin suspension, you may want to visit our website or check with your health care provider or local pharmacist.</p>
<p>Is it safe to use tanning beds while on a Z-pack? Z-Pak azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic which is used to treat various bacterial infections. The most common side effects with Z-Pak are diarrhea and nausea. Other side effects with Z-Pak include photosensitivity or sensitivity to the sun and UV radiation. Granisetron has been associated with QT prolongation, and cases of QT prolongation and TdP have been reported with the post-marketing use of azithromycin.</p>
<p>Severe There have been case reports of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP with the use of azithromycin in postmarketing reports. Other drugs, such as halofantrine, have been specifically established to have a causal association with QT prolongation and TdP and are contraindicated for use with drugs that potentially cause QT prolongation, such as azithromycin.</p>
<p>Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , cautious use of haloperidol with azithromycin is advised.</p>
<p>QT prolongation and TdP have also been observed during haloperidol treatment. Excessive doses particularly in the overdose setting or IV administration of haloperidol may be associated with a higher risk of QT prolongation. Major Consider periodic monitoring of EGCs for QT prolongation and monitor electrolytes if coadministration of histrelin and azithromycin is necessary; correct any electrolyte abnormalities.</p>
<p>Both QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP have been spontaneously reported during azithromycin postmarketing surveillance. Major Avoid coadministration of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine increases the QT interval and should not be administered with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes TdP have been reported with the use of hydroxychloroquine. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with hydroxyzine include azithromycin.</p>
<p>Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , cautious use of ibutilide with azithromycin is advised. Ibutilide administration can cause QT prolongation and TdP; proarrhythmic events should be anticipated.</p>
<p>The potential for proarrhythmic events with ibutilide increases with the coadministration of other drugs that prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p>Major Due to a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , azithromycin and idarubicin should be used together cautiously. Acute cardiotoxicity can occur during the administration of idarubicin; although, the incidence is rare. Major Concurrent use of iloperidone and azithromycin should be avoided due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP.</p>
<p>Iloperidone has been associated with QT prolongation, and cases of QT prolongation and TdP have been reported with the post-marketing use of azithromycin. Major Avoid coadministration of inotuzumab ozogamicin with azithromycin due to the potential for additive QT interval prolongation and risk of torsade de pointes TdP.</p>
<p>If coadministration is unavoidable, obtain an ECG and serum electrolytes prior to the start of treatment, after treatment initiation, and periodically during treatment. Inotuzumab has been associated with QT interval prolongation.</p>
<p>Major Oral compounds known to interact with antacids, like macrolides, should not be taken within 2 hours of dosing with lanthanum carbonate.</p>
<p>If these agents are used concomitantly, space the dosing intervals appropriately. Monitor serum concentrations and clinical condition. Major Lapatinib should be used with caution in patients taking medications that may prolong the QT interval, such as azithromycin; consider ECG and electrolyte monitoring.</p>
<p>Lapatinib has been associated with concentration-dependent QT prolongation; ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes TdP have been reported in postmarketing experience. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to lapatinib administration. Major Lenvatinib should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with azithromycin. Major Due to a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , azithromycin and leuprolide should be used together cautiously.</p>
<p>Major Avoid concurrent use of levofloxacin and azithromycin due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP. Levofloxacin has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Rare cases of TdP have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving levofloxacin.</p>
<p>During the postmarketing period, cases of QT prolongation and TdP were associated with azithromycin. Other drugs, such as levomethadyl, have been specifically established to have a causal association with QT prolongation and torsade de pointes and are contraindicated for use with drugs that potentially cause QT prolongation, such as azithromycin.</p>
<p>Major Lincomycin and macrolide antimicrobials are bactericidal or bacteriostatic via the same or similar mechanisms of action. Antagonism in vitro has been demonstrated when lincomycin was coadministered with erythromycin. It is not recommended to administer these agents together in any combination due to potential antagonism. The manufacturer of lincomycin does not recommend concurrent use of lincomycin with macrolides. Major Due to a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , azithromycin and lithium should be used together cautiously.</p>
<p>Lithium has also been associated with QT prolongation. Lofexidine prolongs the QT interval. In addition, there are postmarketing reports of TdP. Major Loperamide should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with azithromycin. At high doses, loperamide has been associated with serious cardiac toxicities, including syncope, ventricular tachycardia, QT prolongation, torsade de pointes TdP , and cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , caution is advised when administering azithromycin with lopinavir; ritonavir. There have been case reports of QT prolongation and TdP with the use of azithromycin in post-marketing reports, and lopinavir; ritonavir has been associated with QT prolongation. Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , cautious use of maprotiline with azithromycin is advised. Maprotiline has been reported to prolong the QT interval, particularly in overdose or with higher-dose prescription therapy elevated serum concentrations.</p>
<p>Cases of long QT syndrome and TdP tachycardia have been described with maprotiline use, but rarely occur when the drug is used alone in normal prescribed doses and in the absence of other known risk factors for QT prolongation. Limited data are available regarding the safety of maprotiline in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs. Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , caution is advised when administering mefloquine with azithromycin.</p>
<p>There is evidence that use of halofantrine after mefloquine causes a significant lengthening of the QTc interval. Mefloquine alone has not been reported to cause QT prolongation; however due to the lack of clinical data, mefloquine should be used with caution in patients receiving drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as azithromycin.</p>
<p>Post-marketing use of azithromycin has been associated with cases of QT prolongation and TdP. Other drugs, such as mesoridazine, have been specifically established to have a causal association with QT prolongation and torsade de pointes and are contraindicated for use with drugs that potentially cause QT prolongation, such as azithromycin.</p>
<p>Major Use of azithromycin during the post-marketing period has been associated with cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP. The need to coadminister methadone with drugs known to prolong the QT interval, such as azithromycin, should be done with extreme caution and a careful assessment of treatment risks versus benefits. Major The concomitant use of midostaurin and azithromycin may lead to additive QT interval prolongation.</p>
<p>If these drugs are used together, consider obtaining electrocardiograms to monitor the QT interval. In clinical trials, QT prolongation was reported in patients who received midostaurin as single-agent therapy or in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin. Reports of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes have been reported during postmarketing surveillance of azithromycin.</p>
<p>Major Due to the potential for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , caution is advised when administering mifepristone with azithromycin. Mifepristone has been associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval, and rare cases of QT prolongation and TdP have been reported with azithromycin during postmarketing use.</p>
<p>To minimize the risk of QT prolongation, the lowest effective mifepristone dose should always be used. Moderate There may be an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP during concurrent use of mirtazapine and azithromycin. QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP have been spontaneously reported during azithromycin postmarketing surveillance.</p>
<p>Cases of QT prolongation, TdP, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have been reported during postmarketing use of mirtazapine, primarily following overdose or in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, including concomitant use of other medications associated with QT prolongation. Major Concurrent use of moxifloxacin and azithromycin should be avoided due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP.</p>
<p>Prolongation of the QT interval has been reported with administration of moxifloxacin. Post-marketing surveillance has identified very rare cases of ventricular arrhythmias including TdP, usually in patients with severe underlying proarrhythmic conditions.</p>
<p>The likelihood of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of moxifloxacin, therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. According to the manufacturer, moxifloxacin should be avoided in patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval, such as azithromycin. During the post-marketing period, cases of QT prolongation and TdP were associated with azithromycin. Moderate Coadministration of nelfinavir and azithromycin results in increased azithromycin concentrations.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustments are not necessary, although patients should be monitored for azithromycin related adverse effects such as increased hepatic enzymes and hearing impairment. Major Avoid the concomitant use of nilotinib and azithromycin; significant prolongation of the QT interval may occur.</p>
<p>Sudden death and QT prolongation have been reported in patients who received nilotinib therapy. There have been case reports of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes with the use of azithromycin in post-marketing reports.</p>
<p>Sudden deaths and QT prolongation have been reported with nilotinib therapy. Major Due to a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , azithromycin and norfloxacin should be used together cautiously.</p>
<p>Additionally, quinolones have been associated with a risk of QT prolongation and TdP. Although extremely rare, TdP has been reported during postmarketing surveillance of norfloxacin. These reports generally involved patients with concurrent medical conditions or concomitant medications that may have been contributory.</p>
<p>Major Due to a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , azithromycin and octreotide should be used together cautiously. Arrhythmias, sinus bradycardia, and conduction disturbances have occurred during octreotide therapy. Since bradycardia is a risk factor for development of TdP, the potential occurrence of bradycardia during octreotide administration could theoretically increase the risk of TdP in patients receiving drugs that prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p>Until further data are available, it is suggested to use octreotide cautiously in patients receiving drugs which prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p>Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , caution is advised when administering ofloxacin with azithromycin. Some quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with QT prolongation and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Post-marketing surveillance for ofloxacin has identified very rare cases of TdP.</p>
<p>Cases of QT prolongation and TdP have also been reported with the post-marketing use of azithromycin. Major If azithromycin and ondansetron must be coadministered, ECG monitoring is recommended; closely monitor the patient for QT interval prolongation.</p>
<p>Ondansetron has been associated with a dose-related increase in the QT interval and postmarketing reports of torsade de pointes TdP. If ondansetron and another drug that prolongs the QT interval must be coadministered, ECG monitoring is recommended. Azithromycin has also been associated with cases of QT prolongation and TdP during the post-marketing period. Major Avoid coadministration of azithromycin with osimertinib if possible due to the risk of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP.</p>
<p>If concomitant use is unavoidable, periodically monitor ECGs for QT prolongation and monitor electrolytes if coadministration of azithromycin with osimertinib is necessary; an interruption of osimertinib therapy with dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy may be necessary if QT prolongation occurs.</p>
<p>Concentration-dependent QTc prolongation occurred during clinical trials of osimertinib. Major Monitor ECGs and electrolytes in patients receiving oxaliplatin and azithromycin concomitantly; correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to administration of oxaliplatin.</p>
<p>QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal torsade de pointes TdP have been reported with oxaliplatin use in postmarketing experience. QT prolongation and TdP have also been spontaneously reported during azithromycin postmarketing surveillance. Major Concurrent use of paliperidone and azithromycin should be avoided due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP.</p>
<p>If these drugs must be coadministered, close monitoring for QT interval prolongation is advised. Paliperidone has been associated with QT prolongation, and cases of QT prolongation and TdP have been reported with the use of azithromycin during the post-marketing period.</p>
<p>Major QT prolongation has been reported with panobinostat therapy in patients with multiple myeloma in a clinical trial; use of panobinostat with other agents that prolong the QT interval is not recommended. Obtain an electrocardiogram at baseline and periodically during treatment.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with panobinostat include azithromycin. Major Cautious use of pasireotide and azithromycin is needed, as coadministration may have additive effects on the prolongation of the QT interval. Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , coadministration of pazopanib and azithromycin is not advised; both pazopanib and azithromycin have been reported to prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p>If these drugs must be given together, closely monitor the patient for QT interval prolongation. Major Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , caution is advised when administering pentamidine with azithromycin.</p>
<p>Pentamidine has been associated with QT prolongation, and cases of QT prolongation and TdP have been reported with the post-marketing use of azithromycin. Minor Due to an increased risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , caution is advised when administering perphenazine with azithromycin. Perphenazine is also associated with a possible risk for QT prolongation. Theoretically, perphenazine may increase the risk of QT prolongation if coadministered with other drugs that have a risk of QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Major Chloramphenicol and macrolides are bactericidal or bacteriostatic via the same or similar mechanisms of action.</p>
<p>Antagonism in vitro has been demonstrated. Minor Until more data are available, the manufacturer of azithromycin recommends caution and careful monitoring of patients who receive azithromycin with phenytoin. Azithromycin was not implicated in clinical trials with drug interactions with phenytoin. However, specific drug interaction studies have not been performed with the combination of azithromycin and phenytoin.</p>
<p>Major Pimavanserin may cause QT prolongation and should generally be avoided in patients receiving other medications known to prolong the QT interval, such as azithromycin. Coadministration may increase the risk for QT prolongation. Severe Concurrent use of pimozide and macrolides e. Elevated pimozide concentrations occurring through inhibition of CYP3A4 can lead to QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death.</p>

Acute Otitis Media total dosage regimen: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with otitis media under 6 months of age have not been established. Acute Bacterial Sinusitis dosage regimen: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute bacterial sinusitis under 6 months of age have not been established.</p>
<p>Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in pediatric patients 6 months of age or greater is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, similar pathophysiology of acute sinusitis in adults and pediatric patients, and studies of acute otitis media in pediatric patients.</p>
<p>Community-Acquired Pneumonia dosage regimen: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established.</p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness for pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were documented in pediatric clinical trials. Safety and effectiveness for pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were not documented bacteriologically in the pediatric clinical trial due to difficulty in obtaining specimens.</p>
<p>Use of azithromycin for these two microorganisms is supported, however, by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults. Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic parameters in older volunteers 65 to 85 years old were similar to those in younger volunteers 18 to 40 years old for the 5 day therapeutic regimen. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Azithromycin tablets USP, mg contain 0. Potentially serious side effects of angioedema and cholestatic jaundice were reported rarely. Most of the side effects leading to discontinuation were related to the gastrointestinal tract, e. Dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting, melena and cholestatic jaundice. Monilia, vaginitis and nephritis.
