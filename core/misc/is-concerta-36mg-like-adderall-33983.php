		<p><p>They are many drugs in the TCA class. Of them, desipramine may be the best for ADHD, then imipramine. That said, it is possible that other issues like antagonistic behavior may emerge with treatment, meaning that you exchange one set of symptoms for another. On the other hand, treatment with TCAs may provide almost full-time coverage. Note that newer antidepressants, especially the selective serotonin reuptake inihibitors like Prozac and Zoloft have not shown similar efficacy or benefits in treating ADHD.</p>
<p>This may be due to their more specific behavior, and lack of effect on norepinephrine. Modest efficacy, long term coverage Cons: Heart toxicity, overdose possibility, possible new symptoms, not as effective as stimulants 9 Risperdal Risdperdal is a very popular tranquilizing antipsychotic.</p>
<p>It blocks dopamine receptors in the brain, reducing the activity of dopamine. Careful readers may wonder if that is its chemical action, then how can it treat ADHD?</p>
<p>The answer is most likely because Rispderal and its family of medications, the antipsychotics, are tranquilizing and can induce a sense of calm. This can be useful at night in addition to standard treatment to help fall asleep. Use of antipsychotics as sole treatment for ADHD, however, is not a standard medical choice. It does, however, happen, which is unfortunate. Remember, Risperdal has been approved for treatment of agitation and aggression in autistic kids.</p>
<p>Its sedative effects may make it attractive for treating kids who have ADHD and are a handful. The risks are significant. Long term use of Risperdal may lead to permanent movement disorders, extreme weight gain, and diabetes. And long term use of antipsychotics may make concentration and attention problems worse. Sedating, may help fall asleep, may help gain weight Cons: Long term side effects.</p>
<p>It relaxes the mind and body, increases concentration, and improves mood. One kid used to be a handle in school, but when his teachers agreed to let him run around the schoolyard when he got restless, did OK. Winston Churchill, one of the greatest British leaders ever.</p>
<p>But for people who have ADHD, it can make life that much better. Other Drugs of Interest: Withdrawn in US from market due to toxicity to liver. There is no clear advantage any one class of treatment has over the other. Tuckman, a clinician who has treated hundreds if not thousands of patients and is Vice President of the world ADD Association has this to say: Tuckman also emphasizes how important it is to have patience.</p>
<p>He says that is actually quite lucky to get the right dose on the first try and that often you just have to try several doses out until you hit get it right.</p>
<p>Instant Release or Extended Release? Most ADHD medications come in the instant release or extended release form. An instant release pill will typically last hours, while an extended release typically lasts hours. It is our increasingly strong opinion that extended release medications may have superior results than instant release.</p>
<p>This is due to smoother drug release and less need to take medication. Instead of having spikes of drug level, there is a smooth, continuous release over the course of the day. Some studies have shown that a significantly higher amount of people will respond to extended release treatment than to instant release. Its effect can last for up to 12 to 14 hours. Concerta is available in 27mg, 36mg, and 54mg pills to provide flexible dosing options.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of the correct dosage, consult with your health care practitioner. Adderall contains a mix of amphetamine salts, and it is known to work just like Ritalin. It is available in instant-release and extended-release form.</p>
<p>Since its introduction in the 90s, Adderall has become increasingly popular; and it is just a little stronger than Ritalin. When compared, Adderall is slightly more potent than Ritalin. But this only means that you take less of it than Ritalin. Adderall is a psychostimulant containing four amphetamine salts. These are amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine sulfate and dextroamphetamine saccharate.</p>
<p>The amphetamines serve as substrates for dopamine and norepinephrine transporters in place of those neurotransmitters. This means that they are removed from the synapses instead of dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>In this way, Adderall allows the neurotransmitters to act longer. However, the amphetamines in Adderall also have a secondary mechanism of action.</p>
<p>This involves stimulating the release of dopamine and norepinephrine from brain cells into the synapses at nerve endings. Because Adderall contains amphetamines, it can be easily abused. Some other common side effects include anxiety, insomnia, skin rashes, migraine headaches, dry mouth, and agitation. Vyvanse is a central nervous system stimulant. It is known to affect chemicals in the brain and nerves which cause hyperactivity and impulsiveness in children. Vyvanse is used to treat ADHD or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults and children above 6 years of age.</p>
<p>Vyvanse contains lisdexamphetamine dimesylate, a produg made from the combination of dextroamphetamine and L-lysine. The two main reasons for combining amphetamine with an amino acid are to protect dextroamphetamine from enzymes that can break it down before it reaches its target site of action and secondly, to reduce the abuse potential of dextroamphetamine. Because Vyvanse contains only dextroamphetamine, it has fewer side effects than Adderall which contains the two forms of amphetamine.</p>
<p>However, some people respond better to the mixture of amphetamines in Adderall. Attention to detailed tasks is especially challenging. You find it difficult to follow verbal or written instructions. You often lose important items like keys, wallets and passports, which is inconvenient and expensive as well as stressful.</p>
<p>You are frequently late for work or meeting friends and sometimes miss appointments completely. You find it hard to complete a task from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Finishing a task becomes extra hard if the task is boring or stressful. It is much harder for you to pay attention in boring lectures or meetings than it is for your non-ADHD peers. You might be called a couch potato or have people say you lack drive, which can feel hurtful.</p>
<p>Tasks seem to take you longer than other people. People often describe you as a day dreamer. You might rush through a task to get it over with, and later find you missed parts or made mistakes. You are prone to procrastination.</p>
<p>You find it hard to block out noise. You feel extra resistance to starting tasks that involve mental effort.</p></p>
