		<p><p>Next to each dot, write the velocity of the ball at that instant you can make up numbers. I know it is hard to guess the actual velocity without a radar gun, but you can make up numbers 2. Attached to each dot, draw an arrow which indicates the direction of its velocity and magnitude of velocity magnitude is a numerical value. An arrow pointed up indicates the velocity is going in the upward direction.</p>
<p>An arrow pointed down indicates a velocity going down. Attached to each dot, draw an arrow which indicates the direction of its acceleration and magnitude of acceleration magnitude is a numerical value.</p>
<p>Acceleration is how fast it is speeding up and the direction in which it is speeding up. Long arrows indicate big acceleration magnitude. Short arrows indicate small acceleration magnitude. You throw your ball up, it reaches the top of its arc, it comes down, but OOOPPPS, you miss catching it and it falls to the ground below. For you, the entire process takes 7 seconds. Draw this scenario and answer Questions 1 and 3 above.</p>
<p>To determine which would hit the ground first: A horizontally launched projectile, or one dropped vertically. Place one coin at the edge of the table so that it slightly hangs over the edge.</p>
<p>Place the second coin on the table slightly behind the first. With a quick motion, slide the second coin into the first so that both coins will fly off the table. Which coin hit the ground first? Try this experiment with coins of two different denominations eg. Does this make any difference in the results 3. Which coin fell vertically, and which was launched horizontally? In other words, did the coin resting on the edge of the table fly off horizontally, or did it just drop like a stone off the end of the table?</p>
<p>Using dots to represent the coins, draw a picture of the complete flight of your coins as they fall to the ground. Laurent De Muyter, Esq.</p>
