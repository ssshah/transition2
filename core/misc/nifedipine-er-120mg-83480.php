		<p><p>Nifedipine, like other calcium channel blockers, decreases platelet aggregation in vitro. Limited clinical studies have demonstrated a moderate but statistically significant decrease in platelet aggregation and an increase in bleeding time in some nifedipine patients. This is thought to be a function of inhibition of calcium transport across the platelet membrane. No clinical significance for these findings has been demonstrated. Although nifedipine has been used safely in patients with renal dysfunction and has been reported to exert a beneficial effect, in certain cases, rare, reversible elevations in BUN and serum creatinine have been reported in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency.</p>
<p>The relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain in most cases but probable in some. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Nifedipine was administered orally to rats for two years and was not shown to be carcinogenic.</p>
<p>When given to rats prior to mating, nifedipine caused reduced fertility at a dose approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose. There is a literature report of reversible reduction in the ability of human sperm obtained from a limited number of infertile men taking recommended doses of nifedipine to bind to and fertilize an ovum in vitro. In vivo mutagenicity studies were negative. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Nifedipine has been shown to produce teratogenic findings in rats and rabbits, including digital anomalies similar to those reported for phenytoin.</p>
<p>Digital anomalies have been reported to occur with other members of the dihydropyridine class and are possibly a result of compromised uterine blood flow. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Lactation Nifedipine is transferred through breast milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Age appears to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine.</p>
<p>The clearance is decreased resulting in a higher AUC in the elderly. Generally, overdosage with nifedipine leading to pronounced hypotension calls for active cardiovascular support, including monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, judicious use of calcium infusion, pressor agents, and fluids.</p>
<p>Clearance of nifedipine would be expected to be prolonged in patients with impaired liver function. Since nifedipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of any benefit. The main effects of ingestion of approximately mg of PROCARDIA XL in a young man attempting suicide as a result of cocaine -induced depression was initial dizziness, palpitations , flushing, and nervousness. Within several hours of ingestion, nausea, vomiting, and generalized edema developed. No significant hypotension was apparent at presentation, 18 hours post-ingestion.</p>
<p>Vital signs remained stable, no electrocardiographic abnormalities were noted, and renal function returned to normal within 24 to 48 hours with routine supportive measures alone. No prolonged sequelae were observed.</p>
<p>The effect of a single mg ingestion of PROCARDIA capsules in a depressed anginal patient also on tricyclic antidepressants was loss of consciousness within 30 minutes of ingestion, and profound hypotension, which responded to calcium infusion, pressor agents, and fluid replacement.</p>
<p>A variety of ECG abnormalities were seen in this patient with a history of bundle branch block, including sinus bradycardia and varying degrees of AV block.</p>
<p>These dictated the prophylactic placement of a temporary ventricular pacemaker , but otherwise resolved spontaneously. Significant hyperglycemia was seen initially in this patient, but plasma glucose levels rapidly normalized without further treatment. A young hypertensive patient with advanced renal failure ingested mg of PROCARDIA capsules at one time, with resulting marked hypotension responding to calcium infusion and fluids.</p>
<p>No AV conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, or pronounced changes in heart rate were noted, nor was there any further deterioration in renal function. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Nifedipine selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across the cell membrane of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle without altering serum calcium concentrations.</p>
<p>Mechanism of Action Angina The precise mechanisms by which inhibition of calcium influx relieves angina has not been fully determined, but includes at least the following two mechanisms: Relaxation and Prevention of Coronary Artery Spasm Nifedipine dilates the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions, and is a potent inhibitor of coronary artery spasm , whether spontaneous or ergonovine-induced.</p>
<p>This property increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm, and is responsible for the effectiveness of nifedipine in vasospastic Prinzmetal's or variant angina. Whether this effect plays any role in classical angina is not clear, but studies of exercise tolerance have not shown an increase in the maximum exercise rate-pressure product, a widely accepted measure of oxygen utilization.</p>
<p>This suggests that, in general, relief of spasm or dilation of coronary arteries is not an important factor in classical angina. Co-administration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, mg t.</p>
<p>The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to  The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine.</p>
<p>Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t. The corresponding C values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2. Caution should be exercised when co-administering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy.</p>
<p>Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 20 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after co-administration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine.</p>
<p>However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected.</p>
<p>Nifedipine extended-release tablets was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and C of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.</p>
<p>Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered.</p>
<p>Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization.</p>
<p>There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy.</p>
<p>Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and C of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q. Pretreatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate.</p>
<p>The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine.</p>
<p>Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects.</p>
<p>Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t. The C values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.</p>
<p>The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy.</p>
<p>Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if nifedipine is co-administered with rifampin. Rifapentine, as an inducer of CYP3A4, can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. A dose adjustment of nifedipine when co-administered with rifapentine should be considered. Take as directed Nifedipine oral tablet is used for long-term treatment. It comes with serious risks if you don't take it as prescribed.</p>
<p>If you take this drug to treat high blood pressure, your blood pressure may increase. This can raise your risk of health problems such as heart attack or stroke. If you take this drug to treat angina, your chest pain may get worse. Your medication may not work as well or may stop working completely. For this drug to work well, a certain amount needs to be in your body at all times. If you take too much: You could have dangerous levels of the drug in your body.</p>
<p>Symptoms of an overdose of this drug can include: If your symptoms are severe, call or go to the nearest emergency room right away. What to do if you miss a dose: Take your dose as soon as you remember. If you remember just a few hours before your next scheduled dose, take only one dose. Never try to catch up by taking two doses at once. This could result in dangerous side effects.</p>
<p>How to tell if the drug is working: Your doctor can check your blood pressure, or you can do it using a home blood pressure monitor. Keep these considerations in mind if your doctor prescribes nifedipine oral tablet for you. General Adalat CC should be taken on an empty stomach. Other versions of the drug can be taken either with food or on an empty stomach.</p>

Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Is nifedipine causing my constipation? According to drug information, nifedipine is classified as pregnancy category C, which means there are some risks associated with it. What should I avoid? Patients with tight aortic stenosis may be at greater risk 120mg such an event, as the unloading effect of nifedipine would be expected to be of less benefit, owing to the fixed impedance to flow across the aortic valve in these nifedipine. This can cause your body to process drugs more slowly. Take as directed Nifedipine oral tablet is used for long-term treatment, nifedipine er 120mg. Co-administration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, nifedipine er 120mg, mg t. Some tablet forms of nifedipine are made 120mg a shell that is not absorbed or nifedipine in the body. The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in hypertensive patients.
