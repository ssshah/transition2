		<p><p>An excessive rise in blood pressure following discontinuation of CATAPRES tablets therapy can be reversed by administration of oral clonidine hydrochloride or by intravenous phentolamine.</p>
<p>If therapy is to be discontinued in patients receiving a beta-blocker and clonidine concurrently, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual discontinuation of CATAPRES tablets. Because children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, they may be particularly susceptible to hypertensive episodes resulting from abrupt inability to take medication.</p>
<p>In patients who develop an allergic reaction to Catapres-TTS, substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride may also elicit an allergic reaction including generalized rash, urticaria , or angioedema.</p>
<p>The sympatholytic action of clonidine may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular AV block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs.</p>
<p>Blood pressure should be carefully monitored during surgery and additional measures to control blood pressure should be available if required. There was no evidence of genotoxicity in the Ames test for mutagenicity or mouse micronucleus test for clastogenicity. Increased resorptions were not associated with treatment at the same time or at higher dose levels up to 3 times the oral MRDHD when the dams were treated on gestation days 6 to  No adequate, well-controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. The frequency of CNS depression may be higher in children than adults.</p>
<p>Large overdoses may result in reversible cardiac conduction defects or dysrhythmias, apnea , coma and seizures. Signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within 30 minutes to two hours after exposure. As little as 0. There is no specific antidote for clonidine overdosage. Clonidine overdosage may result in the rapid development of CNS depression; therefore, induction of vomiting with ipecac syrup is not recommended. Dialysis is not likely to significantly enhance the elimination of clonidine.</p>
<p>The largest overdose reported to date involved a year old male who ingested mg of clonidine hydrochloride powder. A rapid rise in blood pressure may also occur if the drug is suddenly stopped. The risk is greater if you have used this drug for a long time or in high doses, or if you are also taking a beta blocker such as atenolol.</p>
<p>There have also been rare reports of severe, possibly fatal reactions such as stroke from stopping this drug too quickly. Therefore, it is important that you do not run out of clonidine or miss any doses.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you are unable to take the medication for example, due to vomiting. Other medications may slow down metabolism or cause fluid retention.</p>
<p>However, the effect of prescription drugs on body weight is complex. Some drugs have no effect on weight, while others cause weight gain or weight loss. Also, the same medications can cause weight gain in certain individuals and weight loss in others. There are also drugs that initially cause weight loss and then lead to weight gain with long-term use. Most prescription medications associated with changes in body weight affect the central nervous system. Mood stabilizers lithium, valproic acid , antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants have also been linked with weight gain.</p>
<p>Other drugs that have been reported to cause weight gain include diabetes medications insulin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones , antihypertensive drugs, certain hormonal contraceptives, corticosteroids, antihistamines, some chemotherapy regimens, and antiretroviral protease inhibitors. Catapres clonidine is a medication that is used in the treatment of high blood pressure.</p>
<p>The most common side effects with clonidine are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, sedation, low blood pressure, weakness, and nausea. A search of the prescribing information did not specifically list weight gain as a side effect. This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with clonidine. If you think a drug you are taking is causing weight gain, tell your health care provider. Do not stop any medication or change the dose without first talking to your provider.</p>
<p>Megan Uehara, PharmD Q: Dealing with diabetes and trying to get my numbers down, I took atenolol for 14 yrs at bedtime for blood pressure. Now instead I'm on clonidine. My numbers for blood sugar are high in the morning. My numbers are a little lower in the morning, about 50 pts lower. Does clonidine affect blood sugar levels? I have reviewed your question regarding Tenormin atenolol , Catapres clonidine and your blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>I can find nothing in the available literature to indicate that Catapres clonidine will alter your blood glucose level. It comes with serious risks if you don't take it as prescribed. This can lead to a withdrawal reaction. Side effects may include: How to tell if the drug is working You may be able to tell this drug is working if you notice improvement in your symptoms, especially attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Keep these considerations in mind if your doctor prescribes clonidine for you.</p>
<p>General You can take clonidine with or without food. Take clonidine in the morning and at bedtime: The total daily dose is split into 2 doses. Each dose is usually the same, but sometimes a higher dose is needed. If you have a higher dose, take it at bedtime.</p></p>
