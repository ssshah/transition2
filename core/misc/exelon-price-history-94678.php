		<p><p>In the past, low fossil fuel prices gave given fossil fuel plants a cost advantage over nuclear plants. Record fossil fuel prices after reversed this trend. Nuclear utilities such as Exelon and Entergy began filing for permits for construction of new nuclear plants, with some heralding the arrival of a "nuclear renaissance.</p>
<p>A growing body of scientific evidence ties carbon dioxide emissions to rising temperatures. As a result of growing popular awareness of the risks of global warming, many large corporations have stepped up their efforts to project greener images. Additionally, many expect the U. Environmental awareness is another key trend driving the renaissance of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Compared to their fossil fuel peers, nuclear energy plants have negligible emissions. Again, although Exelon also operates fossil fuel plants, the majority of its energy comes from nuclear plants.</p>
<p>Additionally, Exelon operates many hydroelectric, alternative and renewable energy plants. In all, Exelon stands to benefit from a shift to nuclear energy due to global warming concerns, a fact that has not been lost on the company. The company recently began to push for higher efficiency standards and other environmentally friendly state policies in the areas it operates, probably hoping that a paradigm shift will facilitate a shift towards renewable energy , ultimately benefiting the company.</p>
<p>In its second quarter conference call, Exelon detailed a program, Exelon  A Low-Carbon Road Map, with a goal of offsetting 15 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by  The rest will go to carbon offsets and customer education programs. The design of boiling water and pressurized water reactors employed in the United States and most of the world make it impossible for a Chernobyl type disaster to occur.</p>
<p>The fact that Exelon can generate a kilowatt-hour of energy for only 1. Ultimately, the question of the success of nuclear energy will come down to what people fear more: On August 16, , two Exelon nuclear reactors at Braidwood Generating Station, 60 miles south of Chicago, were shut down for a week due to electrical bus issues.</p>
<p>The shut down emitted loud noise, as well as steam that contained levels of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is testing condensate and water in the system for levels, and state they are likely to fall below regulatory limits.</p>
<p>Should the levels not fall below limits, Exelon will be responsible for cleanup and monitoring, as it did with the Braidwood contamination. It plans to take responsibility by decommissioning the Zion nuclear power station, a task that will take ten years, and upgrading equipment at its six Illinois power plants. Warmer than expected winters can lead to lower demand for heating energy, whereas a cooler than expected summer can lead to lower energy demand for cooling.</p>
<p>Storms can also cost the company millions of dollars, as in June when a storm knocked out power for , PECO customers, forcing the company to put crews to work around the clock to restore power. Each of Exelon's utility businesses face a variety of challenges and potential benefits that may arise from changes in legislation and regulatory schemes: ComEd ComEd in particular is at a crucial juncture in terms of U. Unless new legislation is enacted, will see the transition from artificial, regulated pricing to market rate pricing.</p>
<p>In this way, the transition to market based rates should provide a significant boost to earnings in the coming years.

Investors and security holders will be able to obtain these materials when they are available and other documents filed with the SEC free of charge at the SEC's website, www.</p>
<p>The utility suffered one of the most damaging and traumatic episodes in its history when inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC found a control room employee "inattentive to duty," or, as Amy Barrett of Financial World alleged in a May article, "operators were found playing video games and having rubber band fights in the control rooms" at the Peach Bottom nuclear facility. The plant was ordered closed within 24 hours and remained shut down for over two years.</p>
<p>He set out to transform the company by focusing on long-term strategic planning, human resource management, and downsizing. Over the course of the s and into the s, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission PUC executed several policy reversals with regard to Philadelphia Electric, its nuclear operations, and its rates.</p>
<p>In , the PUC refused to allow a rate hike to pay for the second phase of the plant and halted the project. Three years later, as Limerick's first phase was nearing completion, the Commission gave PE the green light on Limerick II, but set stringent time and financial limitations on the project.</p>
<p>That year, CEO Paquette instituted cost-cutting measures that included an early retirement program, reduced advertising budget, and executive pay cuts of 2 percent to 10 percent.</p>
<p>Paquette himself took his second salary cut that year. The importance of nuclear generation to Philadelphia Electric's operations was reflected in the fact that the nuclear segment of the company's total electric power output was 60 percent in  By the mids, PECO ranked among America's top 25 electric and gas utilities in terms of annual sales in  With a service area of 2, square miles in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the city of Philadelphia, the company served over three million customers.</p>
<p>Paquette retired in leaving Corbin A. Under his leadership, PECO prepared for deregulation by buying troubled nuclear power plants on the cheap, and then reorganizing the facilities to operate at a profit. Even as PECO faced increased competition, earnings per share during grew by 17 percent, which was more than double the industry average at the time. The History of Unicom Samuel Insull helped make Commonwealth Edison an industry giant and in fact laid the foundations of the electrical power industry.</p>
<p>Insull popularized mass production and selling at the lowest possible cost, developed modern public relations, and devised methods for marketing securities in a way that led to the large public corporations of the later 20th century. At the age of 21, Insull possessed outstanding financial acumen and unwavering ambition to succeed in business.</p>
<p>In the early s, he traveled from his home in London to the United States to take his position as Thomas Edison's personal secretary. Insull gained from his employer vast financial responsibilities and decision-making power, while quadrupling sales at Edison Electric Light Company's main factory and selling central power plants to cities across the country.</p>
<p>There were almost four dozen electric companies competing for Chicago's electricity business when Insull came on the scene. At the time, less than 1 percent of Chicago's homes used electric lamps. Insull's goal was to grow--exponentially.</p>
<p>Expansion spelled greater volume, which meant lower unit costs of production, which meant greater profit. More income meant more investment, and more growth, and so on. Insull formed a person sales department and, according to Forrest McDonald's biography of Insull, told them to "sell at the lowest possible price.</p>
<p>He maintained that competition was "economically wrong" and was instead lowering prices in an attempt to wipe out competition all together. Insull quietly bought exclusive rights to electric equipment manufactured by General Electric and most other U.</p>
<p>In his first 42 months in Chicago, Insull increased Chicago Edison's sales almost five times. He also expanded Chicago Edison by buying out competitors. Local politicians soon caught wind of Edison's success. They formed a dummy company, called Commonwealth Electric Company, and gave it a year franchise to provide the city's electricity. They did not realize, however, that Insull owned the rights to the equipment it would take to run this company.</p>
<p>MWU itself was also a publicly traded company. Insull controlled MWU, and by MWU, in turn, controlled utilities in 13 states through relatively small shareholdings.</p>
<p>Insull wanted nothing less than a monopoly wherever he operated, and in order to achieve this, he was willing to sacrifice a degree of control. Therefore, Insull agreed that his exclusive franchises with municipalities should be regulated by a state commission. In , Insull's customers numbered 50,; in , that number had reached , ComEd's growth was both rapid and smart. Insull diversified customers, spreading the demand for power as much as possible.</p>
<p>For instance, he obtained major contracts with Chicago electric streetcar companies, which drew the most power when residential customers were at work and not at home using electric lamps and appliances. He went after big industry, offering huge subsidies to induce these daytime users away from using small, private power stations. Insull termed this approach to business "massing production" and was succeeding at it before Henry Ford gained fame as a mass producer of the automobile.</p>
<p>Taking an idea he learned from the English electricity business, Insull charged a dual rate for power: This covered the costs of adding equipment for new customers and encouraged greater use. He also kept cutting rates. The company, from early on, regularly paid out an eight cent dividend to shareholders. Insull approached generating electricity with the same zeal he showed for selling electricity.</p>
<p>He ignored the apparent limits of the day's technology, pushing his engineers to build generators that were several times larger than any other generators in existence.</p>
<p>Historical accounts suggest that Insull was progressive in his dealings with workers, not out of personal convictions but rather to ensure the effective and continuous operation of ComEd's facilities.</p>
<p>Insull hired women and minorities, gave his employees relatively generous benefits, and maintained a cooperative relationship with labor leaders. Insull was ahead of his time in yet another significant way--he was a master at public relations. He established an advertising department as early as , and his rate cuts were well timed and well publicized. Moreover, he published and distributed a free tabloid, Electric City, which shaped a positive public opinion of electricity, and, of course, the electric company itself.</p>
<p>Insull began publishing annual reports 15 years before they became standard. After World War I, Insull was able to capitalize on the high profile he had cultivated during the war to promote the interests of ComEd. The postwar period was a time of immense growth in demand for the electric industry.</p>
<p>In , the year the electric refrigerator became available to residential customers, ComEd added over 75, new customers to its service area, its largest annual increase up to that time. ComEd proved to be the only major steam-power electric company in the nation that neither raised its rates nor cut its dividends during the postwar period, though money for expansion was scarce.</p>
<p>From to , the number of ComEd shareholders who lived in Illinois grew from 50, to , Insull's name was equated with trust by small investors. The phenomenal control Insull had been able to exercise over his empire's destiny began to crumble around ; he made several less-than-wise, if not illegal, financial moves over the next few years.</p>
<p>After the October stock market crash, Insull, who believed the Great Depression would be short, continued to spend great sums of money on both the company and his many philanthropic endeavors.</p>
<p>During that time, he was perhaps most recognized for his contribution to the Chicago Civic Opera. ComEd continued to grow and its stock continued to rise. Much of this growth, however, was deceptive. Assets and earnings were inflated, and in utility stock prices plunged. Insull had financed much of MWU's growth by using other utility properties as collateral. Eventually he was tried for fraud and embezzlement.</p>
<p>Though Insull was not found guilty, he had left the power industry for good. ComEd itself, however, weathered the Depression relatively well, and business carried on.</p>
<p>Modern conveniences such as the air conditioner and the electric water heater came on the scene in the s and continued to stimulate increased demand for electricity.</p>
<p>During World War II, reserve capacity attracted war industries to the Chicago area; in about 40 percent of the company's yearly output was tied to war production.</p>
<p>In , the city of Chicago conducted a study of ComEd's service and found the company was significantly overcharging, especially residential and commercial customers. The utility's initial franchise with the city was soon to expire, and a battle involving politicians, the utility, and customers ensued.</p>
<p>As a utility overseen by a regulatory commission, ComEd was allowed a reasonable rate of return, but there was a great deal of debate over what "reasonable" meant.</p>
<p>In comparing utilities in the nation's 23 largest cities, ComEd was found to spend twice as much on advertising as any other utility. Critics questioned whether customers should pay higher rates to support advertising of a monopoly. They also wondered if legal fees would be passed on to customers if the city were to take ComEd to court? Although these and other criticisms were addressed in the report, in the media, and by members of the city council, a powerful faction in the city council supported ComEd, and the city ultimately signed a year franchise that did little to address these criticisms.</p>
<p>Some observers believed that neither the franchise agreement nor the state regulatory body, the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC , clearly defined "reasonable rate of return. ComEd's customers did not feel the sting of this arrangement until many years down the road, when Edison's nuclear program ran into decades of cost overruns.</p>
<p>In the short term the company flourished, and customers benefited. In , the company began using an electronic computer for billing, and by ComEd was reaching two million customers. In , ComEd absorbed the Central Illinois Electric and Gas Company, basically establishing an integrated electric system for all of northern Illinois and further capitalizing on economies of scale. In , ComEd began operating the nation's first privately financed commercial nuclear power station, a ,kilowatt facility called Dresden I near Morris, Illinois.</p>
<p>ComEd was leading the national charge toward nuclear power. Harris Ward became ComEd's chairman the next year. He linked the company's growth to nuclear power and committed large sums of capital investment to this program. The utility's ambitious plans called for 40 percent of its entire generating capacity to be supplied by seven nuclear-fueled plants by</p></p>
