		<p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with Alogliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema or severe cutaneous adverse reactions. In such cases, promptly discontinue Alogliptin, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4i because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema.</p>
<p>Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. Baseline liver test panel is recommended. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt Alogliptin and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization.</p>
<p>Do not restart Alogliptin if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative etiology can be found. Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. A lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk when used in combination with Alogliptin.</p>
<p>Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia. Active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or a history of these conditions. Active or recent e. Liver dysfunction or disease. Estradiol Valerate Injection should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to its ingredients.</p>
<p>Known or suspected pregnancy. There is no indication for Estradiol Valerate Injection in pregnancy. There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins from oral contraceptives inadvertently during early pregnancy. Warnings The use of unopposed estrogens in women who have a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer.</p>
<p>Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease e. Coronary heart disease and stroke In the Women's Health Initiative WHI study, an increase in the number of myocardial infarctions and strokes has been observed in women receiving CE compared to placebo. These observations are preliminary.</p>
<p>The increase in risk was observed in year one and persisted. The increase in risk was observed after the first year and persisted. During an average follow-up of 4. Large doses of estrogen 5mg conjugated estrogens per day , comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis.</p>
<p>The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p>
<p>Endometrial cancer The use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to fold greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one year.</p>
<p>The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of to fold for five to ten years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.</p>
<p>Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.</p>
<p>Breast cancer The use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer. The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial and report no significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or progestins, doses, or routes of administration.</p>
<p>In the WHI trial and from observational studies, the excess risk increased with duration of use. From observational studies, the risk appeared to return to baseline in about five years after stopping treatment.</p>
<p>After a mean follow-up of 5. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.</p>
<p>Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups.</p>
<p>The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations.</p>
<p>In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. It is unknown whether these findings apply to estrogen alone therapy. Gallbladder disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.</p>
<p>Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.</p>
<p>Visual abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone.</p>
<p>Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens.</p>
<p>These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer. Elevated blood pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.</p>
<p>Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use. Hypertriglyceridemia In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications.</p>
<p>Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin TBG levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy.</p>
<p>These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. Fluid retention Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed.</p>
<p>Hypocalcemia Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia. After an average follow-up of 5. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations. Exacerbation of endometriosis Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens.</p>
<p>A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy.</p>
<p>For patients known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.</p>
<p>Hypercoagulability Some studies have shown that women taking estrogen replacement therapy have hypercoagulability, primarily related to decreased antithrombin activity. This effect appears dose- and duration-dependent and is less pronounced than that associated with oral contraceptive use. Also, postmenopausal women tend to have increased coagulation parameters at baseline compared to premenopausal women.</p>
<p>There is some suggestion that low dose postmenopausal mestranol may increase the risk of thromboembolism, although the majority of studies of primarily conjugated estrogens users report no such increase. Uterine bleeding and mastodynia Certain patients may develop undesirable manifestations of estrogenic stimulation, such as abnormal uterine bleeding and mastodynia.</p>
<p>Laboratory Tests Estrogen administration should be initiated at the lowest dose approved for the indication and then guided by clinical response rather than by serum hormone levels e. Increased thyroid-binding globulin TBG levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine PBI , T4 levels by column or by radioimmunoassay or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG.</p>
<p>Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum i. Free hormone concentrations may be decreased.</p>
<p>Reduced response to metyrapone test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Long-term continuous administration of estrogen, with and without progestin, in women with and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver. Pregnancy Estradiol Valerate Injection should not be used during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving this drug.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised when Estradiol Valerate Injection is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Large and repeated doses of estrogen over an extended period of time may accelerate epiphyseal closure. Therefore, periodic monitoring of bone maturation and effects on epiphyseal centers is recommended in patients in whom bone growth is not complete.</p></p>
