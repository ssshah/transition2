		<p><p>Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist about all the products you use including prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and herbal products. Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of Coversyl Perindopril Erbumine 8mg, especially dizziness, high potassium levels, and rash. Coversyl Perindopril Erbumine 8mg is not recommended for use during pregnancy. It may harm an unborn baby. Consult your doctor for more details.</p>
<p>It is unknown if perindopril passes into breast milk. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding. Store at room temperature away from light and moisture. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep all medications away from children and pets. Do not flush medications down the toilet or pour them into a drain unless instructed to do so.</p>
<p>Properly discard this product when it is expired or no longer needed. Consult your pharmacist or local waste disposal company. Perindopril is used to treat high blood pressure. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems.</p>
<p>Treatment with Perindopril can be affected by other medicines. If you see another doctor or visit a hospital, remember to tell them what medicines you are already taking. If in doubt take your medicines with you. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking Perindopril Tablets if you: Perindopril Tablets with food and drink It is recommended that Perindopril Tablets should be taken on an empty stomach in order to reduce the influence of food on the way in which the medicine works.</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol with Perindopril Tablets may make you feel dizzy or light-headed. You should check with your doctor whether drinking is advisable for you. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Pregnancy You must tell your doctor if you think you are or might become pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Perindopril before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Perindopril.</p>
<p>For patients taking ramipril capsules: If you have trouble swallowing capsules, you may open the ramipril capsule and mix the medicine with applesauce, water or apple juice. Mix only one dose at a time just before taking it. You may mix a dose ahead of time and save it for no more than 24 hours at room temperature or 18 hours in the refrigerator. If you are unsure about these instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. For patients taking this medicine for high blood pressure: In addition to the use of the medicine your doctor has prescribed, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and care in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium.</p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet. Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well. Remember that this medicine will not cure your high blood pressure but it does help control it.</p>
<p>Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease. Dosing—The dose of the ACE inhibitor will be different for different patients.</p>
<p>Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The number of capsules or tablets that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are taking the ACE inhibitor.</p>
<p>For benazepril For oral dosage form tablets: For high blood pressure: Adults—10 milligrams mg once a day at first. Then, your doctor may increase your dose to 20 to 40 mg a day taken as a single dose or divided into two doses. Children 6 years of age and older—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.</p>
<p>Children under 6 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor. For captopril For oral dosage form tablets: For congestive heart failure: Adults—25 to mg two or three times a day. Children—Dose must be determined by your doctor. Adults—25 to 50 mg two or three times a day.</p>
<p>You may need to read it again. The medicine contains the active ingredient perindopril arginine. Perindopril belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors. Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around the body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are.</p>
<p>You have high blood pressure when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm or relaxed. There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure. The only way of knowing that you have it is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.</p>
<p>Heart failure means that the heart muscle cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack and does not mean that the heart stops working. Some people develop heart failure after having had a heart attack. However there are also other causes of heart failure. Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, you may feel short of breath or may get tired easily after light physical activity such as walking.</p>
<p>In some patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney, who have been treated with ACE inhibitors, increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, have been seen. This is especially likely in patients with renal insufficiency. If renovascular hypertension is also present there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. In these patients, treatment should be started under close medical supervision with low doses and careful dose titration.</p>
<p>Since treatment with diuretics may be a contributory factor to the above, they should be discontinued and renal function should be monitored during the first weeks of Perindopril therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when Perindopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic.</p>
<p>This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Haemodialysis patients Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialysed with high flux membranes, and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In these patients consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or different class of antihypertensive agent.</p>
<p>Kidney transplantation There is no experience regarding the administration of Perindopril in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. This may occur at any time during therapy.</p>
<p>In such cases, Perindopril should promptly be discontinued and appropriate monitoring should be initiated and continued until complete resolution of symptoms has occurred.</p>
<p>In those instances where swelling was confined to the face and lips the condition generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal oedema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, emergency therapy should be administered promptly.</p>
<p>The patient should be under close medical supervision until complete and sustained resolution of symptoms has occurred. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor See section 4.</p>
<p>Intestinal angioedema has been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain with or without nausea or vomiting ; in some cases there was no prior facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan, or ultrasound or at surgery and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor.</p></p>
