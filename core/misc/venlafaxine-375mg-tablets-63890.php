<p>Other considerations during long-term use include checking cholesterol levels to monitor for any increased cholesterol levels. Does Effexor cause weight gain? If you have experienced weight gain, with no changes in diet or activity level, you may want to contact your health care provider. The side effects of Effexor seem worse than depression. The side effects of Effexor venlafaxine are similar to those of other antidepressants. Patients typically notice side effects when they're first starting Effexor, especially in the first two weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>But they usually develop a tolerance for the drug, and the side effect symptoms improve. By the third week of therapy, the benefits of the medication start to become more noticeable. Common side effects of Effexor include drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and nervousness. Dry mouth is another side effect that is considered common.

<p>I take Effexor XR and Ativan when needed. Is this a good combination? Effexor XR is prescribed to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety, and panic disorders. Ativan is prescribed to treat anxiety disorders. Both medications work by altering chemicals in the brain to treat the conditions. Effexor XR and Ativan are commonly prescribed together to treat depression or anxiety.</p>
<p>The interaction that may cause an issue is that when taken together, you may experience more drowsiness than usual, so you need to be cautious about driving or doing hazardous activities. Lori Poulin, PharmD Q: I am taking Effexor. Does this medication keep the weight on? According to the package insert, Effexor venlafaxine may cause weight gain.</p>
<p>There are other factors that can affect body weight. Some of these include chronic stress, hypothyroidism, poor sleep, and quitting smoking. Weight gain is a common symptom of hypothyroidism and it is possible that your medication for hypothyroidism may need to be adjusted. Please consult with your healthcare practitioner for more information.</p>
<p>My insurance will not pay for Effexor XR. So when is the best time to take Effexor, morning or night? Does it make one groggy?</p>
<p>Assuming that you are not taking Effexor XR venlafaxine because of your insurance, the immediate-release tablets are usually dosed in multiple doses throughout the day. According to LexiComp, immediate-released Effexor tablets are dosed in two to three divided doses. This means that you may have to take the tablet two or three times a day. Ideally, this would be equally spaced throughout the day.</p>
<p>Effexor XR capsules or extended-release tablets are usually dosed once daily. Please verify with your health care provider what form of Effexor you have, and also verify how your health care provider wants it dosed for your individual health care needs.</p>
<p>The dosing times would depend on what form of the medication you have and what dosage your physician advises. Jennyfer Marisco, RPh Q: I'd like to know about Effexor. Does it affect weight in menopausal women? Effexor is used in the treatment of menopause and may cause a change in your weight. If you experience abnormal changes in your weight, contact your health care provider about your concerns.</p>
<p>Gerry Levy, RPh Q: Are there any side effects from gradually going off Effexor and replacing it with Wellbutrin? I have had light-headedness and ringing in the ears from the Effexor. If the symptoms you described have only begun occurring recently, and they coincide with changes in the dosages of your medication, you should let your doctor know about this.</p>
<p>You should also discuss changing medications with your doctor, who can address your particular situation. Gregory Latham, RPh Q: I have been taking 75 milligrams Effexor for almost a year. I switched physicians and my new physician prescribed generic Effexor.</p>
<p>Now when I take this med, I feel sick to my stomach for about an hour after. The first pill was a capsule; this is in the pill form. Can it be dissolving too quickly in my stomach and making me feel nauseous? Is there really that much difference between generic versus brand-name pills? Please verify with your health care provider that the new medication is the same release as the former one. Effexor venlafaxine is available as immediate-release tablets as well as extended-release capsules and extended-release tablets.</p>
<p>According to the Food and Drug Administration, all FDA-approved generic drugs meet the same rigid standards as brand-name medications. These generic medications must have the same strength, dosage form, and route of administration as the brand-name medications. Generic medications approved by the FDA must also be bioequivalent to the brand name. Slight differences in fillers and dyes are allowed in generics. According to LexiComp, nausea is listed as an adverse reaction for Effexor venlafaxine with a reporting rate of 21 to 58 percent.</p>
<p>Please consult your health care provider in regards to the nausea and have him or her verify that the new medication is indeed the generic for your former medication. It would also be reasonable to ask your health care provider for the former medication, though insurance copays may be higher. Here's some more information about Effexor: Is there a generic equivalent for Effexor XR available?</p>
<p>There is a generic version of venlafaxine XR the active ingredient in Effexor XR that comes in tablet form, compared with the capsule form of Effexor XR. This basically means that one cannot be substituted for the other.</p>
<p>Doctors needs to specify venlafaxine XR tablets on the prescription, if they want to prescribe the generic form. However, the tablets are not FDA-approved for the treatment of panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, which Effexor XR capsules are. Try asking your doctor if he or she would like to switch you to the generic form, if you wouldn't mind taking the tablets.</p>
<p>And be sure that he or she specifies this on the prescription. I've been on Effexor for many years for depression, but it doesn't seem to be working as well any more. My motivation and energy levels have dropped off, and I don't like the physical dependency that has developed. I get light-headed and have headaches if I miss a dose.</p>
<p>Are there alternatives that I can look at? Tolerance to Effexor can occur over time. In addition, any major issues or changes in your life can also affect the balance of your neurotransmitters, depending on your sensitivity. You should talk to your physician about the possibility of changing your dose don't simply stop taking the Effexor, since such an abrupt change can have serious side effects.</p>
<p>Typically, a physician would increase the dose until you get the same effect that you did when you first started taking it.</p>
<p>Some physicians also prescribe other medications in addition to Effexor. In the meantime, other steps you can take to help your emotional well-being are to try meditating on a daily basis, and avoid "bad" fats and sugary foods. Matt Curley, PharmD Q: Does Effexor make you fat or increase your appetite? Effexor venlafaxine is an antidepressant medication in the drug class serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor SNRIs.</p>
<p>Its possible side effects do include increased appetite and weight gain. It can also cause weight loss and vomiting. Each person reacts to medication differently, but it's possible for Effexor to be causing your symptoms.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that it's actually less likely to cause weight gain then some of the other antidepressants. Laura Cable, PharmD Q: My husband is on Effexor and it is affecting his sex drive and performance. What could be an alternative drug to take? Effexor venlafaxine belongs to the class of medications called serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SNRIs. Most SNRIs, including Effexor, can cause sexual side effects, such as delayed orgasm, reduced libido, and erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>Options for managing the side effects include taking other medications to decrease the side effects or switching to another medication used for depression, anxiety, and panic disorder.</p>
<p>It is important, however, not to abruptly stop taking an antidepressant medication. What is the generic for Effexor XR 75mg? An AB rated generic has identical active ingredients, dosage form, strength and route of administration as the brand name medication.</p>
<p>What is in this leaflet: What Venlafaxine Tablets are and what they are used for 2. What you need to know before you take Venlafaxine Tablets 3. How to take Venlafaxine Tablets 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Venlafaxine Tablets 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Venlafaxine Tablets are and what they are used for Venlafaxine Tablets contains Venlafaxine Hydrochloride as the active ingredient.</p>
<p>Venlafaxine is an antidepressant that belongs to a group of medicines called serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRIs. This group of medicines is used to treat depression and other conditions such as anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>While it is not fully understood how anti-depressants work, Venlafaxine may help by increasing the levels of these substances in your brain. Venlafaxine is a treatment for adults with depression. Treating depression properly is important to help you get better. If it is not treated, your condition may not go away and may become more serious and more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Taking an irreversible MAOI together with Venlafaxine can cause serious or even life- threatening side effects. Also you must wait at least one week after you stop taking Venlafaxine tablets before you can take an MAOI.</p>
<p>Blood pressure should be reviewed periodically, after initiation of treatment and after dose increases. Caution should be exercised in patients whose underlying conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, e. Caution should be exercised in patients whose underlying conditions might be compromised by increases in heart rate. Therefore, it should be used with caution in these patients. In postmarketing experience, fatal cardiac arrhythmias have been reported with the use of venlafaxine, especially in overdose.</p>
<p>The balance of risks and benefits should be considered before prescribing venlafaxine to patients at high risk of serious cardiac arrhythmia. As with all antidepressants, venlafaxine should be introduced with caution in patients with a history of convulsions, and concerned patients should be closely monitored.</p>
<p>Treatment should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. This has most frequently been reported in volume-depleted or dehydrated patients. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and patients who are otherwise volume-depleted may be at greater risk for this event. The risk of skin and mucous membrane bleeding, including gastrointestinal haemorrhage, may be increased in patients taking venlafaxine.</p>
<p>As with other serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine should be used cautiously in patients predisposed to bleeding, including patients on anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors. Measurement of serum cholesterol levels should be considered during long-term treatment. Co-administration of venlafaxine and weight loss agents is not recommended. Venlafaxine is not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.</p>
<p>As with other antidepressants, venlafaxine should be used cautiously in patients with a history or family history of bipolar disorder. This has been reported under initiation, dose changes and discontinuation of treatment. As with other antidepressants, venlafaxine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of aggression. The risk of withdrawal symptoms may be dependent on several factors, including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction. Generally, these symptoms are mild to moderate; however, in some patients they may be severe in intensity.</p>
<p>They usually occur within the first few days of discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have inadvertently missed a dose. Generally, these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged months or more. It is therefore advised that venlafaxine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of several weeks or months, according to the patient's needs see section 4.</p>
<p>This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant while taking this medicine. Do not start or stop taking this medicine during pregnancy without your doctor's advice.</p>
<p>Venlafaxine can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while using this medicine. Venlafaxine is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p>
<p>How should I take venlafaxine? Take venlafaxine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p>
