		<p><p>If you have difficulty swallowing this medication whole, you may sprinkle the entire contents of a capsule on a small amount of applesauce just before taking. Swallow the mixture right away. Do not chew the mixture, and do not save it for future use. Drink a glass of liquid after each dose. The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Your doctor may adjust your dose to find the dose that is best for you. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.</p>
<p>Use this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it at the same time each day. During treatment, your doctor may occasionally recommend stopping the medication for a short time to see whether there are any changes in your behavior and whether the medication is still needed.</p>
<p>To help prevent withdrawal, your doctor may lower your dose slowly. Withdrawal is more likely if you have used this medication for a long time or in high doses. Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you have withdrawal. When this medication is used for a long time, it may not work as well.</p>
<p>Abuse And Dependence Amphetamines have been extensively abused. Tolerance, extreme psychological dependence, and severe social disability have occurred.</p>
<p>There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage to levels many times higher than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG.</p>
<p>Manifestations of chronic intoxication with amphetamines may include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity, and personality changes. The most severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. Adults Sudden deaths, stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD.</p>
<p>Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems.</p>
<p>Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure about mmHg and average heart rate about bpm , and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p>Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e. Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Stimulant Medications Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease e.</p>
<p>Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation. Psychiatric Adverse Events Pre-Existing Psychosis Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with pre-existing psychotic disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.</p>
<p>If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0. Aggression Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD.</p>
<p>Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility. Patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months to the ages of 10 to 13 years , suggests that consistently medicated children i.</p>
<p>Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment. Chronic use of amphetamines can be expected to cause a similar suppression of growth. Seizures There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures.</p>
<p>Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation e. Visual Disturbance Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment. Tics Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic tics and Tourette's syndrome.</p>
<p>Therefore, clinical evaluation for tics and Tourette's syndrome in patients and their families should precede use of stimulant medications. Prescribing And Dispensing The least amount of amphetamine feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. Instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and assist them in understanding its contents.</p>
<p>Give patients the opportunity to discuss the contents of theMedication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions theymay have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Evaluate patient history including family history of abuse or dependence on alcohol, prescription medicines, or illicit drugs [see Drug Abuse And Dependence ]. Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes.</p>
<p>Pregnancy Advise patients to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment [see Use In Specific Populations]. For more information call Pharmacist: Medication Guide to be dispensed to patients Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in which d,l-amphetamine enantiomer ratio of 1: These doses are approximately 2.</p>
<p>Administration of these doses was also associated with severe maternal toxicity. A study was conducted in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine d- to l- enantiomer ratio of 3: These doses are approximately 0.</p></p>
