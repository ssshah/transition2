		<p><p>They may need regular growth checks while they take Topamax. If you become pregnant, contact your doctor.

<p>This drug raises the susceptibility of developing kidney stones so you have to drink plenty of water and other non-calorie fluids to cleanse the kidneys. It causes a burning sensation paresthesia around the mouth that gives impaired taste and reduced physical movements. It can cause eye problems like permanent loss of vision, if not treated properly. So tell to your doctor about any eye problems you have before and during treatment. It decreases sweating and makes it more difficult for your body to cool down.</p>
<p>It raises suicidal thoughts or actions which include panic attacks, agitation, irritability, anxiety, depression, thinking or talking about suicides, sleep problems etc.</p>
<p>Immediately discuss these with your doctor so the necessary steps can be taken to prevent it. Avoid consuming high fat, low — carbohydrate diet which result in excess acid in the blood. It leads to some cognitive problems such as thinking, paying attention, memory, concentration, confusion, dizziness and sleepiness. Avoid alcohol and sedating drugs as topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of certain drugs like birth control pills and other over the counter medications and supplements.</p>
<p>Sudden stopping of this medicine will cause serious problems, so talk with your health care provider or doctor before you stop taking this medicine. Follow these tips to get complete benefit of losing overweight without any health problems.</p>
<p>Always take this medication by first consulting your doctor. Always go with the recommended dosage and no more. The drug may numb or alter the way rewards are processed, leading to people feeling less hungry or experiencing less cravings for food. Another school of thought suggests that the drug may be altering levels of hormones such as cortisol and leptin. Specifically the drug may be decreasing the amount of leptin that is found in cortisol, as well as cortisol itself. Leptin is a hormone that regulates appetite, and when reduced, people tend to feel less hungry.</p>
<p>Also when cortisol the stress hormone is reduced, the body tends to store less fat, which will lead to weight loss. Those that take Topamax may feel so disoriented as a result of their treatment, that they may have a difficult time functioning and remembering to actually eat. While this may sound silly, this drug can have potent effects on memory, lead some people to feel dizzy, and result in profound disorientation.</p>
<p>Those that feel disoriented as a result of treatment may forget to eat or may not want to eat as much. This drug may also be affecting levels of blood glucose as well as insulin, which could promote ketosis, a state by which the body uses its own fat as fuel. When in ketosis, your body uses up fat stores to give you energy, often resulting in significant weight loss.</p>
<p>Some speculate that Topamax may artificially induce ketosis. Loss of taste sensation: A specific theory as to why Topamax reduces ability to taste has to do with reduced saliva production. Those that take the drug tend to experience reductions in the amount of saliva produced on a daily basis. I'm so excited, because I know that the slower I take it off, the more apt I am to keep it off. I'm not quite at my goal weight yet, but I know in time I'll get there. I am also taking escitalopram, Lexapro mg a day because I had panic attacks.</p>
<p>At first I thought Topiramate was gonna make them reappear but it did not so I am happy. I am still hungry all the time but My stomach hurts and I am going to the bathroom every time I eat anything. I am still waiting for it to do some effect I am slowly going up with my dose I am on 25 mg twice a day and in 4 days I will start with 50mg twice a day and then mg twice a day I was lbs all the way up until I was  I keep reading horror stories that sound like I will have a personality transformation and never be normal again.</p>
<p>I am considered obese and need help with weight loss. Can anyone reassure me about this drug? Read More Has anyone had any experience in determining what is the most effective dose of topamax for weight loss? I seemed to almost do better on the smaller dosage. Anyone have similar experience?
