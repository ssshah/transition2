		<p><p>They may also have more severe symptoms and a greater risk of death when they become ill. The anatomy of anxiety Anxiety is a reaction to stress that has both psychological and physical features.</p>
<p>The feeling is thought to arise in the amygdala, a brain region that governs many intense emotional responses. As neurotransmitters carry the impulse to the sympathetic nervous system, heart and breathing rates increase, muscles tense, and blood flow is diverted from the abdominal organs to the brain.</p>
<p>In the short term, anxiety prepares us to confront a crisis by putting the body on alert. But its physical effects can be counterproductive, causing light-headedness, nausea, diarrhea, and frequent urination.</p>
<p>And when it persists, anxiety can take a toll on our mental and physical health. Anxiety as illness Research on the physiology of anxiety-related illness is still young, but there's growing evidence of mutual influence between emotions and physical functioning. Yet anxiety often goes unidentified as a source of other disorders, such as substance abuse or physical addiction, that can result from attempts to quell feelings of anxiety.</p>
<p>And it's often overlooked in the myriad symptoms of chronic conditions like irritable bowel syndrome IBS or migraine headache.</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of the estimated 40 million adults with anxiety disorders are women. What people with these disorders have in common is unwarranted fear or distress that interferes with daily life see chart. Anxiety also plays a role in somatic symptom disorder, which is characterized by physical symptoms such as pain, nausea, weakness, or dizziness that have no apparent physical cause.</p>
<p>Anxiety has been implicated in several chronic physical illnesses, including heart disease, chronic respiratory disorders, and gastrointestinal conditions.</p>
<p>When people with these disorders have untreated anxiety, the disease itself is more difficult to treat, their physical symptoms often become worse, and in some cases they die sooner. Anxiety disorders and their symptoms Disorder Symptoms Generalized anxiety disorder Exaggerated worry about health, safety, money, and other aspects of daily life that lasts six months or more.</p>
<p>Reply Link Andy May 24, , 3: Zoloft sertraline has helped me a lot, but I still have some GAD issues. I developed neuropathy pain in my feet, and was prescribed Gabapentin for that.</p>
<p>I noticed that I slept better, and was generally calmer, and suspected that it was because of the Gabapentin, so I did some research, and ended up here. Looks like I was correct! Reply Link Emma Goldman May 20, , 5: At the time, I thought I was less anxious because I was getting pain relief, but eventually I realized that the anxiety relief was a separate thing.</p>
<p>I have PTSD so anxiety is an ongoing issue for me. After my shoulder got good enough to transition off the gaba, I occasionally would take a mg dose to help with anxiety without thinking too much of it. Now, my sleep doctor is pushing me to go on Prozac to help with my chronic insomnia and anxiety. Well, I am going to try going back on the Gaba first. One other thing to add — like another poster above me said: Once while I was on the Gaba, I started feeling so awful — dizzy, horrible, etc. Then I realized it all started within 24 hours of my getting my Gaba refill with a different manufacturer.</p>
<p>Good luck to all. Reply Link dave brent May 24, ,  And what was the good brand you switched to? Having the pharmacy switch to another one resolved the issue! Some months went by and I began feeling the same negative reaction.</p>
<p>Sure enough when I looked it was that same manufacturer! I now look each and every time! I take this for anxiety, mood disorder, and fibromyalgia and it definitely works at mg 3x. Reply Link whocares May 14, , 7: I changed Drs because I wanted more Xanax, it was impossible to detox from 1.</p>
<p>However, once starting this combo, almost 3 weeks ago, I have totally stopped Xanax and I think I only drank twice. Both times, I think I forgot my pills the night before. Prior to starting, I was craving alcohol every single day and drinking times per week in addition to 1mg of Xanax. So this combo has been sort of a miracle for me. I still filled my last Xanax script. And, I filled my Ambien script also despite no need or desire for Ambien.</p>
<p>He gave me scripts for 90 days worth of Baclofen and days of Gabapentin. So I am currently planning to wait until I run out or low on Baclofen.</p>
<p>The combo causes me to fall asleep every night sometimes before I plan to or can even take my pills. And it causes some dizziness and blurred vision. But overall, I am thrilled for the withdrawals to stop. I had figured it would take me a year and a half to wean off Xanax without becoming an alcoholic in the process.</p>
<p>So when the Dr refused to give me any more Xanax, I was skeptical, but the proof is in the pudding. Reply Link Ken May 10, , 8: They then brand their own generic Gabapentin through Greenstone. A generic mtf may work for one but not another person.</p>
<p>However, Pharmacy and pharmaceutical companies are in business to make money so they purchase the cheapest generic on the market through wholesale distribution most likely in Canada.</p>
<p>Here is a very serious problem the size of the generic may be 3 times as big as the brand! It could also be a tablet not a capsule form. The generics are not the same as brand. They have different formularies, diff binders and fillers, lacquers.</p>
<p>They may not be bio-equivalent, bio-available or pharmacokinetics within the rule. There are so many manufacturing being built in India and China, the FDA does not have the require inspectors to test for purity so it is playing Russian roulette every time you get a generic.</p>
<p>Different dangerous side effects, may not even work. This is why you get a different generic every time you get a refill. Always ask for the same generic if it works for you. Many recalls on drugs caused of purity issues. Solco seems to work. Reply Link Zoe April 12, ,  I have numerous mental disorders including high anxiety, panic attacks, PTSD, depression, borderline personality, mild bipolar, and am 5 years sober with a previous addiction to alcohol and marijuana. When I tried to wean off, I realized that it had been helping, not only the neuropathic pain, but also my anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>My quality of life, especially my peace of mind, has increased with the use of mg 3x per day. Reply Link Marvi April 2, , 5: It was prescribed for Anxiety NOS and panic attacks. My dose is mg four times a day. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p>
<p>You may take this medicine with or without food, but take it the same way each time. Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are taking this medicine. After you begin taking buspirone, 1 to 2 weeks may pass before you begin to feel the effects of this medicine. Dosing The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine.</p>
<p>If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.</p>
<p>Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine. For oral dosage form tablets: Your doctor may increase your dose as needed. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p>
<p>Xanax XR Description Xanax XR Tablets contain alprazolam which is a triazolo analog of the 1,4 benzodiazepine class of central nervous system-active compounds. The molecular formula is C17H13ClN4 which corresponds to a molecular weight of  The structural formula is represented below: Alprazolam is a white crystalline powder, which is soluble in methanol or ethanol but which has no appreciable solubility in water at physiological pH.</p>
<p>Each Xanax XR extended-release tablet, for oral administration, contains 0. The inactive ingredients are lactose, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and hypromellose. Slideshow Xanax XR - Clinical Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics CNS agents of the 1,4 benzodiazepine class presumably exert their effects by binding at stereospecific receptors at several sites within the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Their exact mechanism of action is unknown. Clinically, all benzodiazepines cause a dose-related central nervous system depressant activity varying from mild impairment of task performance to hypnosis.</p>
<p>Peak concentrations in the plasma occur in one to two hours following administration. Plasma levels are proportional to the dose given; over the dose range of 0. Using a specific assay methodology, the mean plasma elimination half-life of alprazolam has been found to be about  The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of alprazolam following administration of Xanax XR Tablets are similar to that for XANAX Tablets, with the exception of a slower rate of absorption.</p>
<p>The slower absorption rate results in a relatively constant concentration that is maintained between 5 and 11 hours after the dosing. Multiple dose studies indicate that the metabolism and elimination of alprazolam are similar for the immediate-release and the extended-release products.</p>
<p>Food has a significant influence on the bioavailability of Xanax XR Tablets. Serum albumin accounts for the majority of the binding. Metabolism Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P 3A4 CYP3A4 , to two major metabolites in the plasma: A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.</p>
<p>The benzophenone metabolite is essentially inactive. Elimination Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine. The mean plasma elimination half-life of alprazolam following administration of Xanax XR Tablet ranges from  Special Populations While pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed in special populations with Xanax XR Tablets, the factors such as age, gender, hepatic or renal impairment that would affect the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam after the administration of XANAX Tablets would not be expected to be different with the administration of Xanax XR Tablets.</p>
<p>Changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of benzodiazepines have been reported in a variety of disease states including alcoholism, impaired hepatic function, and impaired renal function. Changes have also been demonstrated in geriatric patients. A mean half-life of alprazolam of  In patients with alcoholic liver disease the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 5.</p>
<p>In an obese group of subjects the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 9. Because of its similarity to other benzodiazepines, it is assumed that alprazolam undergoes transplacental passage and that it is excreted in human milk.</p></p>
