		<p><p>Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1, live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of pregnant women with a history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission.</p>
<p>Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. When treating a pregnant woman with fluoxetine, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant.</p>
<p>The decision can only be made on a case by case basis [see Dosage and Administration 2. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of fluoxetine at doses up to  However, because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility that fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>In one breast milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine was  No adverse effects on the infant were reported. In another case, an infant nursed by a mother on fluoxetine developed crying, sleep disturbance, vomiting, and watery stools. Manic reaction, including mania and hypomania, was reported in 6 1 mania, 5 hypomania out of 2. As with other SSRIs, decreased weight gain has been observed in association with the use of fluoxetine in children and adolescent patients.</p>
<p>After 19 weeks of treatment in a clinical trial, pediatric subjects treated with fluoxetine gained an average of 1. In addition, fluoxetine treatment was associated with a decrease in alkaline phosphatase levels. The safety of fluoxetine treatment for pediatric patients has not been systematically assessed for chronic treatment longer than several months in duration.</p>
<p>In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the longer-term effects of fluoxetine on the growth, development and maturation of children and adolescent patients. Therefore, height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>Anyone considering the use of fluoxetine in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. Animal Data Significant toxicity on muscle tissue, neurobehavior, reproductive organs, and bone development has been observed following exposure of juvenile rats to fluoxetine from weaning through maturity.</p>
<p>When animals were evaluated after a drug-free period up to 11 weeks after cessation of dosing , fluoxetine was associated with neurobehavioral abnormalities decreased reactivity at AUC as low as approximately 0. In addition, the testicular and epididymal microscopic lesions and decreased sperm concentrations found in high dose group were also observed, indicating that the drug effects on reproductive organs are irreversible.</p>
<p>The reversibility of fluoxetine-induced muscle damage was not assessed. These fluoxetine toxicities in juvenile rats have not been observed in adult animals. Rat exposures to the major metabolite, norfluoxetine, are approximately 0. A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine by the intraperitoneal route to 4 week old mice for 4 weeks at doses 0.</p>
<p>Yes What are the side effects of fluoxetine? Fluoxetine, as with most antidepressants, can cause nausea , headaches , anxiety , insomnia , drowsiness, and loss of appetite. Fluoxetine has been implicated in serious skin rashes and vasculitis inflammation of small blood vessels. Increased blood pressure can occur, and blood pressure should be monitored.</p>
<p>Seizures have been reported as has sexual dysfunction. Some patients may experience withdrawal reactions upon stopping fluoxetine. Symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety , nausea , nervousness, and insomnia. This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. Do not take fluoxetine together with pimozide Orap , thioridazine Mellaril , or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor MAOI such as furazolidone Furoxone , isocarboxazid Marplan , phenelzine Nardil , rasagiline Azilect , selegiline Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar , or tranylcypromine Parnate.</p>
<p>A dangerous drug interaction could occur, leading to serious side effects. You may have thoughts about suicide when you first start taking an antidepressant, especially if you are younger than 24 years old. Results of a number of published epidemiological studies assessing the risk of fluoxetine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy have demonstrated inconsistent results.</p>
<p>More than 10 cohort studies and case-control studies failed to demonstrate an increased risk for congenital malformations overall. There was no specific pattern of cardiovascular malformations. Overall, however, a causal relationship has not been established. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis , apnea , seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia , hypertonia , hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying.</p>

<p>Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. When treating a pregnant woman with PROZAC, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of fluoxetine at doses up to  However, because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility that fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<p>A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine by the intraperitoneal route to 4 week old mice for 4 weeks at doses 0. There was a decrease in bone mineralization and density at both doses, but the overall growth body weight gain or femur length was not affected.</p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness of PROZAC and olanzapine in combination in patients less than 10 years of age have not been established. The efficacy in geriatric patients has been established [see Clinical Studies ]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Hepatic Impairment In subjects with cirrhosis of the liver, the clearances of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, were decreased, thus increasing the elimination half-lives of these substances. A lower or less frequent dose of fluoxetine should be used in patients with cirrhosis.</p></p>
