		<p>The effect of codeine, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.</p><h2>Tylenol-Codeine</h2><p>Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known. Codeine is secreted into human milk. In women with normal codeine metabolism normal CYP2D6 activitythe amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent. Despite the common use of codeine products to manage postpartum pain, reports of adverse events in infants are rare.</p><img src="http://www.drugs.com/images/pills/mmx/t108934b/acetaminophen-and-codeine-phosphate.jpg" alt="acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg" title="acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="438" height="280" align="left" ><p>However, some women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. These women achieve higher-than-expected serum levels of codeine's active metabolite, morphine, leading to higher-than-expected levels of morphine in breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants.</p>
<p>Therefore, maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including death, in nursing infants.</p><img src="http://images.rxlist.com/images/healthwise.1.0/medical/multum/acetaminophen-codeine300mg-30mg-ran.jpg" alt="acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg" title="acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="403" height="233" align="left" ><p>The risk of infant 300 to codeine and morphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/fluoxetine-20mg-pmt.33916_812.php">fluoxetine 20mg pmt</a> the mother and baby. Caution should be exercised when codeine is administered to a nursing woman. If a codeine-containing product is selected, the lowest dose should <b>30mg</b> prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect.</p>
<p>Mothers using codeine should be acetaminophen about when to seek immediate medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, such as codeine or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby. Nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing.</p>
<p>These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in non-ambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down, acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg. Other adverse reactions include allergic reactions, euphoria, dysphoria, constipation, abdominal pain, <i>acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg</i>, pruritus, rash, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis.</p>
<p>At higher doses codeine has most of the disadvantages of morphine including respiratory depression.

<p>Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.</p>
<p>Assisted or controlled ventilation should also be considered. Nursing mothers taking codeine can also have higher morphine levels in their breast milk if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers.</p><img src="http://pillbox.nlm.nih.gov/assets/large/006032337.jpg" alt="acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg" title="acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="311" height="269" align="left" ><p>These higher phosphates of morphine in breast milk may lead to life-threatening or fatal side effects in nursing babies. Instruct nursing mothers 300 watch for 30mg of morphine toxicity in their infants including increased sleepiness more than usualdifficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness.</p>
<p>Instruct nursing mothers to talk to the baby's doctor immediately if they notice these acetaminophen and, acetaminophen 300 mg codeine phosphate 30mg, if they cannot reach the doctor right away, to take the baby to an emergency room or call or codeine emergency services.</p>
<p>This drug may enhance the effects of: Codeine may increase serum amylase levels. Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.</p>
