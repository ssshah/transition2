It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays. Slight maternal toxicity clinical signs and decreased body weight gain and food consumption was seen at this dose.</p>
<p>This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity clinical signs, decreased body weight gain. Thus, teratogenic effects of racemic citalopram were observed at lexapro maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with <b>lexapro</b> citalopram 4.</p>
<p>The no-effect dose was A no-effect dose was not determined in that study.

Nevertheless, lexapro 10 mg ou 20 mg, lexapro sensitivity of some elderly individuals to effects of Lexapro cannot be ruled out, lexapro 10 mg ou 20 mg.</p>
<p>SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, <i>lexapro 10 mg ou 20 mg</i>, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [see Hyponatremia]. Of patients in clinical studies of racemic citalopram, lexapro 10 mg ou 20 mg, were 60 and over, were 65 and over, and were 75 and over.

As with other SSRIs, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of escitalopram has been rarely reported. Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose. Management Of Overdose Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation.</p>
<p>Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of escitalopram, forced diuresisdialysishemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/bluelight-codeine.67449_487.php">Bluelight codeine diphenhydramine</a> are no specific antidotes for Lexapro.</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose.</p>
