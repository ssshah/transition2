		<p><p>For a complete list of recalled products, please see the recall notice and list of products 1. We are investigating the products and facilities associated with this recall and will provide updates as we learn more. The products include certain liquid infant? Why were these products recalled? McNeil Consumer Healthcare is initiating this voluntary recall because some of these products may not meet required quality standards.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, parents and caregivers should not administer these products to their children. Some of the products included in the recall may contain a higher concentration of active ingredient than specified; others contain inactive ingredients that may not meet internal testing requirements; and others may contain tiny particles.</p>
<p>If you take a prescription medication containing Tylenol acetaminophen , make sure to figure that dosage into your total daily dosing to make sure you stay below mg in a day, or less.</p>
<p>There was a recall on some of the Tylenol acetaminophen products, because a "moldy" smell was found. The stores quickly pulled them, and what you see on the shelf now will not be a recalled product. If you have Tylenol Extra Strength acetaminophen that was bought prior to the recall, you can check to see if what you bought is on the recall list. Is infant Tylenol safe to buy after the recall?</p>
<p>Most of the reputable stores have pulled all of the affected medications off the shelves. Typically, I tell most patients to give it some time for full recovery from the process and use an alternative generic brand in the meantime. What sypmtoms do you get after quitting Tylenol PM? None of the ingredients in Tylenol PM is at all addictive, so there should be no symptoms associated with quitting.</p>
<p>If you were taking Tylenol PM for an extended period of time and are now having any unpleasant feelings, it is always a good idea to check with one Q: How safe is taking mg of Tylenol for an extended period for recuperation from surgery?</p>
<p>Tylenol acetaminophen is a medication used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and fever. The maximum daily dose of Tylenol acetaminophen is 4 grams or 4, mg. It is important to include all sources of Tylenol acetaminophen in calculating the total daily dose as acetaminophen is found in many over the counter medications including cold medications.</p>
<p>Those with liver or kidney disease may need lower doses. Patients who drink three or more alcoholic beverages a day should avoid Tylenol acetaminophen due to the risk of liver damage. Other than the above cautions it is considered safe to take 4, mg or less of acetaminophen a day. What pain medicine can I take for headaches while I'm pregnant? Tylenol acetaminophen is believed to be safe in pregnancy when used intermittently for short durations. Acetaminophen has not been formally assigned to a pregnancy category by the FDA.</p>
<p>However, it is routinely used for short term pain relief and fever in all stages of pregnancy. Acetaminophen should only be given during pregnancy when need has been clearly established. Consult your health care provider for specific recommendations. Always read and follow the complete directions and warnings on over-the-counter medications and discuss their use with your doctor before taking them. Should I stop taking the drug?</p>
<p>Your question raises two possible issues. First, there was a recent recall of Tylenol products. This recall is in addition to a product recall that McNeil Consumer health care originally announced on January 15, , which included liquid products that contained trace amounts of a chemical called 2,4,6-tribromoanisole TBA.</p>
<p>The risk of serious adverse medical events is remote. This recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the U. The additional recall is a precautionary measure after a continuing internal review determined that some packaging materials used in the lots had been shipped and stored on the same type of wooden pallet that was tied to the presence of TBA in earlier recall.</p>
<p>Consumers who purchased product from the lots included in this recall should stop using the product and contact McNeil Consumer health care for instructions on a refund or replacement. For these instructions, and information regarding how to return or dispose of the product, consumers should log on to the internet at www. Eastern Time, and Saturday-Sunday 9 a.</p>
<p>Consumers who have medical concerns or questions should contact their health care provider. Any adverse reactions may also be reported to the FDA Q: What is the Tylenol recall about? Which ones and why? McNeil Consumer health care announced a voluntary recall on many of their over-the-counter Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl, and Zyrtec products.</p>
<p>Consumers were complaining of a musty or moldy smell which has been linked to a chemical found in the shipping materials where product was shipped and stored on. Consumers are advised not take any medications from the recalled lots and contact McNeil Consumer health care for instruction on refund or replacement. For more information on the recall and complete list of lot numbers, visit McNeil Q: Will Tylenol harm your body if taken every day?</p>
<p>Doses higher than this can lead to liver damage, as the medication leaves the body through a pathway in the liver. Alcohol also leaves the body through the liver, and if it is combined with Tylenol acetaminophen over a long period of time, liver damage may occur. Some prescription medications, for pain, also contain Tylenol acetaminophen , so if you take pain medicine with the abbreviation "APAP" in the name, make sure your total amount of daily Tylenol acetaminophen does not exceed mg 4grams.</p>
<p>They work differently than Tylenol acetaminophen and have the additional function of decreasing inflammation. However, people with a history of ulcers or GI gastrointestinal bleeding should not take NSAIDs, as they block the prostaglandins that make your blood clot, and can cause a GI bleed.</p>
<p>If you can limit all of the pain relievers to just when they are needed, instead of everyday, they may be "safer" than taking them everyday. You can also ask your doctor for liver and kidney function tests. Sometimes, the benefits, versus risks must be weighed to make a decision, and you should talk to your doctor about this. Tylenol acetaminophen is an analgesic used to treat mild to moderate pain and fever. The maximum daily dose of Tylenol acetaminophen is mg 4grams daily.</p>
<p>It is important to note that some prescription pain medications or cough and cold medications also contain acetaminophen. It is important to not have more than 4 grams of acetaminophen a day from all sources. Tylenol acetaminophen can affect the liver so patients who already have liver damage should avoid taking Tylenol acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Patients who drink more than 3 alcoholic drinks a day should avoid taking Tylenol acetaminophen due to the increased risk of liver damage. Why was Tylenol recalled? Which Tylenol has been recalled? The recall involves one lot number of this product.</p>
<p>The recall only involves brand name Tylenol and not generic products made by other companies. McNeil is working with the U. Information for the public is available at the company's website: The website contains specific information on which products and lot numbers are affected. It gives access to customer support and information about refunds and product coupons.</p>
<p>For specific questions or concerns about the recall, please contact McNeil directly for the most accurate information. Tylenol acetaminophen is a pain reliever and a fever reducer. It is used to treat many conditions such as headache, muscle aches, arthritis, backache, toothaches, colds, and fevers.</p>
<p>Brand name Tylenol is available in a variety of dosage forms and strengths. And acetaminophen is widely available in generic form. So, there are a many choices available for continued use of acetaminophen during McNeil's recall. Your local pharmacist is a good resource to help you choose a product that is right for you. Always read and follow the complete directions and warnings on over-the-counter products and discuss their use with your health care provider before taking them.</p>
<p>Never take more Tylenol than directed on the label. Too much Tylenol can be dangerous and damaging to your liver. If you do not understand the directions on the product label, consult your doctor or local pharmacist for help. Sarah Lewis, PharmD Q: When will the Tylenol recall end? The reason for the recall is because consumer complaints of a musty or moldy odor, which has been linked to the presence of trace amounts of a chemical called 2,4,6-tribromoanisole TBA has been found in some containers of Tylenol products with certain lot numbers.</p>
<p>Not all Tylenol acetaminophen products are affected, only certain Tylenol products with certain lot dates. The only affected Tylenol products are Children Q: What Tylenol products were recalled? Was generic Tylenol involved also? Has there been a new recall on Tylenol products?</p>
<p>Yes, as of July 9, , another Tylenol recall was announced including adult and children's medications. For all products that are included in the recall, you should visit the manufacturer website where you can find all the information you need. This website also offers a place where you can input your product information that you have at home to see if it is one of the lots affected. Click on this link for more information: Is it safe to take tylenol during pregnancy a few times a week for body aches?</p>
<p>Tylenol acetaminophen is usually safe during pregnancy. Excessive acetaminophen can cause liver failure. Also stay away from ibuprofen and aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs because these drugs can reduce amniotic fluid and thin the blood. This could make it harder to stop a hemorrhage or bleeding during labor. What is an alternative to Children's Tylenol? The generic name for Tylenol is acetaminophen so just check for that ingredient in the generic versions.</p>
<p>If you are trying to avoid Tylenol completely, children's Motrin generic name ibuprofen would be the alternative medication. Is there a recall on tylenol rapid release? According to McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the manufacturer of Tylenol, five lots of medication have been recalled in addition to the primary recall of products back in January  If your bottle of Tylenol Extra Strength Rapid Release Gelcaps is part of the recalled lot, you can request a refund or product coupon from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Beth Isaac, PharmD Q: Why was Tylenol suddenly recalled? Should I dump out what I still have in my cupboard? On May 1, , McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the manufacturer, voluntarily recalled infant and children's liquid products due to manufacturing deficiencies that may have affected quality, purity, or potency.</p>
<p>It is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the U. The active ingredient in Tylenol, acetaminophen, accounts for more than , calls to poison centers, roughly 60, emergency-room visits and hundreds of deaths each year in the U. In England, it is the leading cause of liver failure requiring transplants. I end up transplanting three to four patients per year, and two to three die before we can transplant them. It is probably the most dangerous OTC drug in this country.</p>
<p>According to the safety communication, two U. Women reporting any acetaminophen use in pregnancy were also significantly more likely to have a child with a hyperkinetic disorder HKD diagnosis or a child who used ADHD medications, compared to unexposed women, according to the FDA.</p>
<p>In , McNeil recalled many Tylenol brands because a chemical for treating wood made it into the medicine, causing nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In , it expanded the recall to include several more lots of the medication. Approximately 11 million bottles containing varying quantities of acetaminophen mg caplets are affected by this recall. For a list of batches affected, please see. Consumers can determine if they are in possession of a recalled product by locating the batch number printed on the container label.</p>
<p>A list of stores that carry store-brands potentially affected by this recall is located on FDA's website. To date, there have been no illness or injuries received related to this problem and no consumer complaints have been reported to the FDA or to Perrigo.</p></p>
