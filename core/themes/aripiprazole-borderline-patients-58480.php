		<p><p>In this trial, the efficacy of Abilify for the maintenance treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder was not established.</p>
<p>Maintenance efficacy in pediatric patients has not been systematically evaluated. In addition, delayed sexual maturation was observed in males. At all doses and in a dose-dependent manner, impaired memory and learning, increased motor activity, and histopathology changes in the pituitary atrophy , adrenals adrenocortical hypertrophy , mammary glands hyperplasia and increased secretion , and female reproductive organs vaginal mucification, endometrial atrophy, decrease in ovarian corpora lutea were observed.</p>
<p>The changes in female reproductive organs were considered secondary to the increase in prolactin serum levels. All drug-related effects were reversible after a 2-month recovery period, and most of the drug effects in juvenile rats were also observed in adult rats from previously conducted studies. All drug-related effects were reversible after a 2-month recovery period. Placebo-controlled studies of oral Abilify in schizophrenia, bipolar mania, or major depressive disorder did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p>
<p>Placebo-controlled studies of Abilify injection in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p>
<p>Drug Abuse and Dependence Abilify is not a controlled substance. Abuse Abilify has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of Abilify misuse or abuse e.</p>
<p>Dependence In physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. Overdosage MedDRA terminology has been used to classify the adverse reactions. Human Experience In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience, adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral Abilify have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral Abilify alone and in combination with other substances.</p>
<p>No fatality was reported with Abilify alone. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with Abilify overdoses alone or with other substances include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia.</p>
<p>Management of Overdosage No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Abilify. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.</p>
<p>Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. In the event of an overdose of Abilify, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole.</p>
<p>Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with Abilify, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins. Aripiprazole is 7-[4-[4- 2,3-dichlorophenyl piperazinyl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril.</p>
<p>The chemical structure is: Inactive ingredients include cornstarch, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. The inactive ingredients for this solution include disodium edetate, fructose, glycerin, dl-lactic acid, methylparaben, propylene glycol, propylparaben, sodium hydroxide, sucrose, and purified water.</p>
<p>The oral solution is flavored with natural orange cream and other natural flavors. Abilify Injection is available in single-dose vials as a ready-to-use, 9. Inactive ingredients for this solution include  Abilify - Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in schizophrenia or bipolar mania, is unknown.</p>
<p>However, the efficacy of aripiprazole could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Interactions with dietary supplements Do you know any negative interactions there are taking it with St. I have not seen studies were individuals were given both, but I would be careful mixing them since they are both potent and have several effects on neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic Medicine and Personality Disorder Treatment The anti-psychotic drug Abilify aripiprazole appears to be effective for patients with borderline personality disorder, often leading to improvements in health-related quality of life and interpersonal problems. Personality disorder is a type of mental illness in which people have trouble functioning with others. It can be associated with depression and psychopathological symptoms.</p>
<p>A few antipsychotic agents have been used in therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. The most common side effects reported with aripiprazole were headache, insomnia, nausea, numbness, constipation and anxiety.</p>
<p>American Journal of Psychiatry,  Role of aripiprazole in treating mood disorders. Atypical antipsychotics have been used to treat patients with schizophrenia for many years, but now there is increasing evidence of their utility in the treatment of mood disorders.</p>
<p>Aripiprazole and a metabolite 2,3-DCPP were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, produced increases in numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation.</p>
<p>A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice; however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice and of monkeys did not reveal evidence of retinal degeneration. Additional studies to further evaluate the mechanism have not been performed.</p>
<p>The relevance of this finding to human risk is unknown. However, due to Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.</p></p>
