		<p><p>Opioid narcotic pain medications killed an estimated 14, people in the U. A further 14, people overdosed on heroin, another opioid that many people turn to when they can't access prescription painkillers.</p>
<p>See Pain Killer Addiction Treatment This epidemic is why physicians and pharmacists are increasingly raising the bar on who can receive opioid medications, how much, and for how long.</p>
<p>It's not just the addiction risk that calls for caution when using opioids to treat chronic pain thoughâ€”long-term use of opioids can actually make pain worse. See Opioid Medication Potential Risks and Complications Physical impact of painkillers Becoming addicted to pain medication is a disease. This is because these painkillers oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone, fentanyl cause a change in your brain chemistry that is not under your control. Most people who take opioids for more than 2 to 4 weeks will develop a tolerance to the medication.</p>
<p>Tolerance means your body may need an increased dosage to feel the same effect. Has anyone else had similar symptons and still negative results on blood work for rhmeutoid arthritis? Any help would be appreciated. I have been to 5 doctors now. I have not worked for 2 months. Have checked my only kidney as well. Read More It is very common in adults older than 45 and can cause joint pain. Joint pain may also be caused by bursitis inflammation of the bursae.</p>
<p>The bursae are fluid-filled sacs that cushion and pad bony prominences, allowing muscles and tendons to move freely over the bone. For nonarthritis joint pain, both rest and exercise are important. Warm baths, massage, and stretching exercises should be used as frequently as possible.</p>
<p>Anti-inflammatory medications may help relieve pain and swelling. Read More Hi all, I was wondering if anyone has any muscle and joint pain before tx? I told my dr that I had very bad muscle and joint pain and he told me to go to my regular dr which I dont have one because he thought it was not from the Hep C I dont know what else it could be from and I have tried taking Tylenol, Tylenol 8 hr, and Tylenol Arthritis Please I am open to any suggestions on what works.</p>
<p>Read More And, the pain I can hardly take it anymore. I am planning a trip to Mayo in Feb or March - whenever I can get in. My body feels like it is collapsing. Docs say not EDS and I agree. They are trying me on Enbrel. All my joints catch and crunch. Really scary, in fact. How can we get in touch with each other?</p>
<p>Read More some days I have to wash her hair for her, and even aplly her deodorant because she is unable to raise her arms due to shoulder pain. Joint pain and swelling began immediately after she started Accutane. Her dermatologist lowered the dosage and told us the side effect was temporary. She finished her course, and her skin is gorgeous now.</p>
<p>The cost, however, has been devastating. Her doctors tell us Accutane did not cause the arthritis. Read More effects are felt immediately Read More We're in Spring now but we've been getting belated rain and are now having a few storms, so my aches are playing up.</p>
<p>I get a lot of hip pain , my hands cramp up and I get more leg and back pain. I hear you both and I know what you're talking about: I had a friend rub my arm today to say congats on a scholarship I won and it hurt I have had chronic back pain for years, and have been epiduraled, trigger point injected, facet joint injected, x-rayed, MRI'd, chiropractered, acupunctured, etc etc etc - none of which ever resulted in either a solid diagnosis nor pain relief.</p>
<p>The meds were a last line resort. I have been on them for a few years. Read More You will have the runs I would go 20 times a day , headache, joint aches, very hot and sweaty, nervousness, shakiness and you might cry I know this is probably the wrong way to deal with it but I went to the pharmacy and bought some sudafed with the psudophedrine in it and took that to get the "buzz" THEN, I used some valium that I had for my insomnia which you wont sleep for a few days, either and it worked just fine.</p>
<p>It was the worst withdraw I have had yet. Read More I have type 1a stage 2 4th day of tx viral ct 8 million. I have joint pain , but had it before tx.. My dr, primary phy would not give me hydrocodone with the stuff that tylenol had in it, but did give me vicodine with the stuff advil has as primary pain reliver.. I have read in this forum that the accetametophin hope I spelled it correctly is not harmful as long as alcohol is not involved Read More as every muscle and joint is just screaming at me that they are in pain when the pain should only be in my knee, is this the effect of the drugs and will this end if I can get off this stuff?</p>
<p>Thanks again you don't know how much you have helped, just having someone that understands what I am going through as I don't dare tell family members.</p></p>
