		<p><p>Faro S, Fenner DE. Perfetto EM, Gondek K. Escherichia coli resistance in uncomplicated urinary tract infection: Diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Infect Dis Clin North Am. Infections of the urinary tract in women: Successful implementation of an evidence-based clinical practice guideline: Orenstein R, Wong ES.</p>
<p>Urinary tract infections in adults. What treatment approach do you recommend? If the first treatment doesn't work, what will you recommend next? Am I at risk of complications from this condition? What is the risk that this problem will recur?</p>
<p>What steps can I take to reduce my risk of a recurrence? Should I see a specialist? Don't hesitate to ask other questions as they occur to you during your appointment. What to expect from your doctor Your doctor will likely ask you several questions, including: When did you first notice your symptoms? Have you been treated for a bladder or kidney infection in the past?</p>
<p>How severe is your discomfort? How often do you urinate? Are your symptoms relieved by urinating? Do you have low back pain? Treatment regimens for uncomplicated cystitis in nonpregnant women are provided in Table 1, below. Complicated Cystitis in Nonpregnant Women Complicated cystitis is associated with an underlying condition that increases the risk of therapeutic failure.</p>
<p>Some underlying conditions include diabetes, symptoms for 7 days or longer before seeking care, renal failure, functional or anatomic abnormality of the urinary tract, renal transplantation, an indwelling catheter stent, or immunosuppression. Treatment regimens for complicated cystitis in nonpregnant women are provided in Table 2, below.</p>
<p>Patients with complicated cystitis who can tolerate oral therapy may be treated with the following options: Patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy as outlined above or patients with infection that is suspected to be due to resistant organisms should be treated with parenteral therapy, as follows: Parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy once clinical improvement is observed.</p>
<p>Antimicrobial Therapy Oral therapy with an antibiotic effective against gram-negative aerobic coliform bacteria, such as E coli, is the principal treatment intervention in patients with lower urinary tract infections. For women with acute bacterial cystitis who are otherwise healthy and not pregnant, 3 days of therapy with most antimicrobial agents is generally more effective than single-dose therapy and as effective as the same drug administered for a longer duration.</p>
<p>Cystitis in older women or infection caused by Staphylococcus saprophyticus is less responsive to 3 days of therapy; therefore, 7 days of therapy is suggested. In a analysis by Olson et al,  Resistance to ciprofloxacin was 1. The authors recommended considering nitrofurantoin as a first-line agent for uncomplicated lower UTIs.</p>
<p>Fosfomycin a single dose of 3 g with oz of water is also an appropriate choice for therapy, where available, because of minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage. It has been reported that the efficacy of single-dose fosfomycin is inferior to that of standard short-course regimens.</p>
<p>According to the IDSA guidelines, beta-lactam agents eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, cefaclor, cefpodoxime-proxetil in 3‚Äî7-day regimens are appropriate second-line choices when other recommended agents cannot be used.</p>
<p>The IDSA advises against using amoxicillin or ampicillin for empiric treatment, because these agents have relatively poor efficacy and high rates of resistance. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously with anagrelide include sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists: Moderate QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes TdP have been reported during post-marketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim.</p>
<p>Acute cardiotoxicity can occur during administration of daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, or idarubicin; cumulative, dose-dependent cardiomyopathy may also occur. Sinus tachycardia is the most common arrhythmia, but other arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia SVT , ventricular tachycardia, heart block, and premature ventricular contractions PVCs have been reported. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include apomorphine.</p>
<p>Minor Use caution if sulfamethoxazole and aprepitant are used concurrently and monitor for a possible decrease in the efficacy of sulfamethoxazole. After administration, fosaprepitant is rapidly converted to aprepitant and shares the same drug interactions. The effects of aprepitant on tolbutamide were not considered significant. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include aripiprazole.</p>
<p>Major Avoid coadministration of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim and arsenic trioxide. QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes TdP have been reported during post-marketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. If possible, drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval should be discontinued prior to initiating arsenic trioxide therapy. If concomitant drug use is unavoidable, frequently monitor electrocardiograms. QT prolongation should be expected with the administration of arsenic trioxide.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include artemether. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include asenapine. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include atomoxetine.</p>
<p>QT prolongation has occurred during therapeutic use of atomoxetine and following overdose. Atomoxetine is considered a drug with a possible risk of TdP. No difference was observed in atovaquone pharmacokinetics. This may not be of any clinical significance but should be used with caution. Major Sulfonamides can crystallize in an acidic urine. Because methenamine salts produce an acidic urine, these agents should not be used concomitantly. Moderate Azathioprine may interact with other drugs that are myelosuppressive.</p>
<p>Drugs that may affect the production of leukocytes, including sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim, SMX-TMP, may lead to exaggerated leukopenia, especially in patients who have received a renal transplant.</p>
<p>Minor Folate antagonists, such as trimethoprim, especially when used in high doses or over a prolonged period, inhibit dihydrofolate reductase and thus may inhibit the action of folic acid, vitamin B9.</p>
<p>Minor L-methylfolate and trimethoprim should be used together cautiously. Plasma concentrations of L-methylfolate may be reduced when used concomitantly with trimethoprim. Monitor patients for decreased efficacy of L-methylfolate if these agents are used together.</p>
<p>Major Due to a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , azithromycin and sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim should be used together cautiously. QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and TdP has been reported during postmarketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. In addition, there have been case reports of QT prolongation and TdP with the use of azithromycin in postmarketing reports. Concurrent use may increase the risk of QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include bedaquiline.</p>
<p>Moderate Rare and sometimes fatal cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported with the use of topical or oromucosal benzocaine products. Examples of other drugs that can cause methemoglobinemia include the sulfonamides.</p>
<p>Therefore, caution is warranted when combining such medications with topical or oromucosal benzocaine products. Patients using OTC benzocaine gels and liquids should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if signs or symptoms of methemoglobinemia develop. In addition, clinicians should closely monitor patients for the development of methemoglobinemia when benzocaine sprays are used during a procedure.</p>
<p>Bismuth Subcitrate Potassium; Metronidazole; Tetracycline: Major Potential QT prolongation has been reported in limited case reports with metronidazole; therefore, it should be used cautiously when adminstered with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim, which has a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP. Also, medications with significant alcohol content should not be ingested during therapy with metronidazole and should be avoided for 3 days after therapy is discontinued.</p>
<p>Bismuth Subsalicylate; Metronidazole; Tetracycline: Moderate Close clinical monitoring is advised when administering sulfamethoxazole with boceprevir due to an increased potential for sulfamethoxazole-related adverse events. If sulfamethoxazole dose adjustments are made, re-adjust the dose upon completion of boceprevir treatment. Although this interaction has not been studied, predictions about the interaction can be made based on the metabolic pathway of sulfamethoxazole.</p>
<p>Sulfamethoxazole is partially metabolized by the hepatic isoenzyme CYP3A4; boceprevir inhibits this isoenzyme. Coadministration may result in elevated sulfamethoxazole plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>Moderate Sulfamethoxazole potently inhibits CYP2C9 and may theoretically lead to elevated plasma concentrations of bosentan when coadministered. Monitor for potential adverse effects of bosentan during coadministration. Excessive bosentan dosage may result in hypotension or elevated hepatic enzymes. Bromocriptine is highly bound to serum proteins. Therefore, it may increase the unbound fraction of other highly protein-bound medications e.</p>
<p>Moderate Coadministration of lidocaine with oxidizing agents, such as sulfonamides, may increase the risk of developing methemoglobinemia. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia if coadministration is necessary. If methemoglobinemia occurs or is suspected, discontinue lidocaine and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care; more severe symptoms may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen.</p>
<p>Buprenorphine has also been associated with QT prolongation and has a possible risk of torsade de pointes TdP. FDA-approved labeling for some buprenorphine products recommend avoiding use with Class 1A and Class III antiarrhythmic medications while other labels recommend avoiding use with any drug that has the potential to prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p>Moderate Use caution if coadministration of capecitabine with sulfamethoxazole is necessary, and monitor for an increase in sulfamethoxazole-related adverse reactions. Megaloblastic anemia can occur when sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim, SMX-TMP is used in patients who are taking other folate antagonists. These agents include carbamazepine. If these agents are used concomitantly, close observation of blood counts is warranted. Major Avoid coadministration of ceritinib with sulfamethoxazole due to increased sulfamethoxazole exposure; additive QT prolongation may also occur.</p>
<p>If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor for sulfamethoxazole-related adverse reactions. Periodically monitor electrolytes and ECGs; an interruption of ceritinib therapy, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy may be necessary if QT prolongation occurs.</p>
<p>Sulfamethoxazole is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9; QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes TdP has been reported during postmarketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. These agents include chloramphenicol.</p>
<p>Para-aminobenzoic acid, PABA, in turn, antagonizes the effects of sulfonamides. Thus, ester-type local anesthetics should not be used in patients receiving sulfonamides.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include chloroquine. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include chlorpromazine.</p>
<p>Choline Salicylate; Magnesium Salicylate: Moderate Trimethoprim has a potassium-sparing effect on the distal nephron and may induce hyperkalemia. Trimethoprim should also be used with caution with other drugs known to cause significant hyperkalemia such as potassium salts. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>Severe QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes TdP and death, have been reported with cisapride. QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and TdP have been reported during post-marketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. Because of the potential for TdP, concurrent use is contraindicated. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include citalopram.</p>
<p>Citric Acid; Potassium Citrate: Thus, clopidogrel could increase plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by this isoenzyme, such as sulfamethoxazole.</p>
<p>Although there are no in vivo data with which to predict the magnitude or clinical significance of this potential interaction, caution should be used when sulfamethoxazole is coadministered with clopidogrel. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include clozapine. Cobicistat; Elvitegravir; Emtricitabine; Tenofovir Alafenamide: Moderate Caution is warranted when elvitegravir is administered with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim, SMX-TMP as there is a potential for decreased sulfamethoxazole concentrations.</p>
<p>Moderate Promethazine carries a possible risk of QT prolongation. Major Monitor ECGs for QT prolongation and monitor electrolytes in patients receiving crizotinib concomitantly with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. An interruption of therapy, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy may be necessary for crizotinib patients if QT prolongation occurs. Crizotinib has been associated with concentration-dependent QT prolongation. QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes TdP has also been reported during postmarketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include cyclobenzaprine. Major Avoid the concomitant use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim and cyclosporine. There have been reports of significant, but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration in renal transplant patients.</p>
<p>In addition, there are case reports of reduced exposure to cyclosporine in patients receiving concomitant sulfonamides. Monitor renal function and cyclosporine concentrations if concomitant use is required.</p>
<p>Major Agranulocytosis has been reported in the second to third month of weekly concomitant treatment with dapsone and other hemolytic agents such as folic acid antagonists e. These combinations increase the likelihood of adverse hematologic events. Concurrent administration of dapsone with trimethoprim increases the plasma concentrations of both drugs.</p>
<p>The efficacy of dapsone is increased, which may provide a therapeutic advantage in the treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia; however, an increase in the frequency and severity of dapsone toxicity methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia also has been noted.</p>
<p>Dasabuvir; Ombitasvir; Paritaprevir; Ritonavir: However, the Cmax of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was not affected. In addition, both ritonavir and sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim are associated with QT prolongation; concomitant use increases the risk of QT prolongation. Minor According to the manufacturer, no dosage adjustments are required when trimethoprim is administered with dasabuvir; ombitasvir; paritaprevir; ritonavir; however, use of these drugs together may result in elevated dasabuvir plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>Trimethoprim inhibits CYP2C8, an enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolism of dasabuvir. Caution and close monitoring are advised if these drugs are administered together. Major Monitor for evidence of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP during concurrent use of dasatinib and sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. In vitro studies have shown that dasatinib has the potential to prolong the QT interval. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include degarelix.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include halogenated anesthetics. Clinically relevant QTc prolongation may occur with deutetrabenazine. QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes TdP has been reported during postmarketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim.</p>
<p>Dextromethorphan; Guaifenesin; Potassium Guaiacolsulfonate: Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include quinidine. Moderate Anti-infectives that disrupt the normal GI flora, including sulfonamides, may potentially decrease the effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>Moderate It would be prudent to recommend alternative or additional contraception when oral contraceptives OCs are used in conjunction with antibiotics. It was previously thought that antibiotics may decrease the effectiveness of OCs containing estrogens due to stimulation of metabolism or a reduction in enterohepatic circulation via changes in GI flora. One retrospective study reviewed the literature to determine the effects of oral antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive estrogens and progestins, and also examined clinical studies in which the incidence of pregnancy with OCs and antibiotics was reported.</p>
<p>It was concluded that the antibiotics ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, ofloxacin, roxithromycin, temafloxacin, and tetracycline did not alter plasma concentrations of OCs. Based on the study results, these authors recommended that back-up contraception may not be necessary if OCs are used reliably during oral antibiotic use. Another review concurred with these data, but noted that individual patients have been identified who experienced significant decreases in plasma concentrations of combined OC components and who appeared to ovulate; the agents most often associated with these changes were rifampin, tetracyclines, and penicillin derivatives.</p>
<p>These authors concluded that because females most at risk for OC failure or noncompliance may not be easily identified and the true incidence of such events may be under-reported, and given the serious consequence of unwanted pregnancy, that recommending an additional method of contraception during short-term antibiotic use may be justified. During long-term antibiotic administration, the risk for drug interaction with OCs is less clear, but alternative or additional contraception may be advisable in selected circumstances.</p>
<p>Data regarding progestin-only contraceptives or for newer combined contraceptive deliveries e. Major Because both trimethoprim and digoxin undergo tubular secretion, trimethoprim can interfere with the renal tubular secretion of digoxin when administered concomitantly. Similar changes were not noted in a single-dose study of young healthy volunteers. Patients receiving digoxin, especially the elderly, should be monitored carefully for digoxin toxicity if trimethoprim is added.</p>
<p>Thus, naproxen may displace other highly protein bound drugs from albumin or vice versa. If naproxen is used concurrently with sulfonamides, monitor patients for toxicity from either drug.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include disopyramide. Major The ingestion of ethanol by patients receiving disulfiram causes an extremely unpleasant reaction that can last from 30 minutes to several hours.</p>
<p>Intravenous sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim, SMX-TMP, cotrimoxazole contains ethanol and should not be co-administered with disulfiram. This reaction would not be expected to occur with oral sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. Severe The concurrent use of dofetilide with trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated. Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of renal cationic secretion and decreases the renal tubular secretion of dofetilide.</p>
<p>Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include dolasetron. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include rilpivirine. Major Case reports indicate that QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP can occur during donepezil therapy.</p>
<p>Donepezil is considered a drug with a known risk of TdP. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with donepezil include sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim, SMX-TMP, cotrimoxazole.</p>
<p>Moderate Cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion, such as trimethoprim, may decrease memantine elimination by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Moderate Cytochrome P enzyme inhibitors, such as sulfamethoxazole, may inhibit the hydroxylation of doxercalciferol, thereby decreasing the formation of the active metabolite and thus, decreasing efficacy. Major Use caution if coadministration of dronabinol with sulfamethoxazole is necessary, and monitor for an increase in dronabinol-related adverse reactions e.</p>
<p>Concomitant use may result in elevated plasma concentrations of dronabinol. Severe The concomitant use of dronedarone with other drugs that prolong the QTc and that may induce torsade de pointes TdP is contraindicated. QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes TdP have been reported during post-marketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim, SMX-TMP, cotrimoxazole. Dronedarone administration is associated with a dose-related increase in the QTc interval. The increase in QTc is approximately 10 milliseconds at doses of mg twice daily the FDA-approved dose and up to 25 milliseconds at doses of mg twice daily.</p>
<p>Although there are no studies examining the effects of dronedarone in patients receiving other QT prolonging drugs, coadministration of such drugs may result in additive QT prolongation. Additionally, dronedarone is metabolized by and is an inhibitor of CYP3A. Sulfamethoxazole is a substrate for CYP3A4.</p>
<p>The concomitant administration of dronedarone and sulfamethoxazole may result in increased exposure of sulfamethoxazole. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously and with close monitoring with sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim include droperidol.</p>
<p>Drospirenone; Ethinyl Estradiol; Levomefolate: Major Coadministration of efavirenz and sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim may increase the risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP. QT prolongation has been observed with use of efavirenz. Although data are limited, the manufacturer of efavirenz recommends an alternative antiretroviral be considered for patients receiving medications with a known risk for TdP.</p>
<p>QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and TdP has been reported during post-marketing use of sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim. Efavirenz; Lamivudine; Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate:</p></p>
