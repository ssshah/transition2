		<p><p>Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment. Manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on therapy. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression.</p>
<p>Patients receiving super-potent corticosteroids should not be treated for more than 2 weeks at a time, and only small areas should be treated at any one time due to the increased risk of HPA suppression. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid.</p>
<p>Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur that require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.</p>
<p>Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. How is this medicine Temovate best taken? Use Temovate clobetasol cream, gel, and ointment as ordered by your doctor.</p>
<p>Read all information given to you. Follow all instructions closely. Use as you have been told, even if your signs get better. Do not take Temovate clobetasol cream, gel, and ointment by mouth.</p>
<p>Use on your skin only. Keep out of your mouth, nose, and eyes may burn. Wash your hands before and after use. Do not wash your hands after use if putting this on your hand. Clean affected part before use. Make sure to dry well. Put a thin layer on the affected skin and rub in gently. Do not put on the face, underarms, or the groin area unless told to do so by the doctor.</p>
<p>Do not use coverings bandages, dressings, make-up unless told to do so by the doctor. What do I do if I miss a dose? Put on a missed dose as soon as you think about it. If it is close to the time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your normal time. Do not put on 2 doses at the same time or extra doses. Dosage Information in more detail What are some side effects that I need to call my doctor about right away? Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms that may be related to a very bad side effect: Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing; tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p>
<p>Signs of high blood sugar like confusion, feeling sleepy, more thirst, more hungry, passing urine more often, flushing, fast breathing, or breath that smells like fruit. Signs of Cushing's disease like weight gain in the upper back or belly, moon face, very bad headache , or slow healing.</p>
<p>Signs of a weak adrenal gland like a very bad upset stomach or throwing up, very bad dizziness or passing out, muscle weakness, feeling very tired, mood changes, not hungry, or weight loss. Skin changes pimples , stretch marks, slow healing, hair growth.</p>
<p>Irritation where Temovate clobetasol cream, gel, and ointment is used. Thinning of the skin. Change in eyesight, eye pain , or very bad eye irritation. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids.</p>
<p>They are therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during or after withdrawal of treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. HPA axis suppression, Cushing syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and an absence of response to ACTH stimulation.</p>
<p>Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. While the number of patients is too small to permit separate analysis of efficacy and safety, the adverse reactions reported in this population were similar to those reported by younger patients. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear.</p>
<p>However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor , arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.</p></p>
