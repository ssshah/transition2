            <h1>Celebrex with pain killer</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>I clean houses for a living and that involves A LOT of moving, bending, and twisting and by the time I get home the pain is unbearable most days and the percocet doesn't even touch it!</p>
<p>It feels almost like a kidney infection, I don't know how else to describe it but you described it to a T! I am on day 2 of Celebrex after doing some research about othe options besides percocet I came across celebrex and decided to talk to my doctor. I am tired of being treated like a drug addict for a pill that doesn't work for all my pain. He gave me a perscription for celebrex and cut me down to 2 percocets a day and I'm hoping the celebrex works well enough that I can eventually quit the percocet all together.</p>
<p>My doctor is not vey helpful at all and I think because I am only 38yrs old he doesn't seem to think my pain is all that bad. I have had to ask him to put me on anything I have taken so far when it should be him going down the list and trying different things untill we find one that works! I mean HE is the doctor, not me! I am hopeful that celebrex will be the one that works for most of my pain. I am so glad I found this forum as it feels good to know that I am not alone!</p>
<p>Thanks again for sharing your experience, it is greatly appreciated! Back pain and surgeries are just so painful to recover from. I'm not speaking from experience from back surgery, but I've had 2 hips and 1 knee replaced and shoulder surgery.</p>
<p>The knee is doing well just with occasional pain. At first, of course, they give you the heavy hitters and then they weaned me off and put me on Celebrex. I still have chronic OA in the other joints in my body.</p>
<p>My left knee is going to need to be replaced but I'm holding off as long as possible. Back to the Celebrex, it really isn't working for me at all. Can't figure it out with all the great reviews it receives. I'm in bed all day with pain some days worse than others. The recommendation is that sulfa-allergic patients avoid this medication.</p>
<p>I've been using Celebrex for 4 months because of arthoscopic knee surgery. The pills helped in the beginning and they are not helping now.</p>
<p>Could it be because I stand all day on my job? Does it cause weight gain? The pain can be caused by excessive use and standing all day. You might want to try a knee brace to use at work, which might alleviate some of the strain. If that doesn't help, talk with your physician to see what other solutions you can come up with.</p>
<p>I am taking Celebrex for knee inflammation. The bottle says not to take aspirin at the same time, but can I take ibuprophen and acetaminophen along with the Celebrex? According to the package insert, Celebrex should not be taken with aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDS including ibuprofen Motrin, Advil , naproxen Aleve, Naprosyn , diclofenac Cataflam, Voltaren , diflunisal Dolobid , etodolac Lodine , flurbiprofen Ansaid , indomethacin Indocin , ketoprofen Orudis , ketorolac Toradol , mefenamic acid Ponstel , meloxicam Mobic , nabumetone Relafen , or piroxicam Feldene.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is in a different class of pain relievers not a NSAID , and studies have shown that Celebrex and acetaminophen Tylenol can be used together. It is important to take all drugs in the recommended doses and alert your healthcare provider of all prescription and over-the-counter medicines that you are taking.</p>
<p>Can a person who is allergic to sulfa drugs take Celebrex? A sulfa allergy refers to adverse reactions to sulfonamides, a group of drugs that includes antibiotics and nonantibiotics.</p>
<p>The antibiotic sulfonamides are different structurally from the nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and they appear to be much more likely to result in allergic reactions. Many of the sulfa nonantibiotics, therefore, do not cause problems in people with sulfa antibiotic allergy. Celebrex celecoxib , a popular medication used for the treatment of arthritis and for controlling pain, is a sulfonamide nonantibiotic medication.</p>
<p>Although there have been no reports of sulfa-allergic patients reacting to Celebrex, it is a theoretical concern, so the recommendation is that sulfa-allergic patients avoid this medication. Here is a link to more information on Celebrex: Lori Poulin, PharmD Q: Is there something effective that can replace Celebrex?</p>
<p>Celebrex celecoxib belongs to the class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs. It reduces inflammation and pain in the body. If you were taking Celebrex for arthritis, there are many different approaches to arthritis treatment. Finding the right treatment or combination of treatments will depend on your particular symptoms and any other medical conditions you may have.</p>
<p>If this is not what you intended to ask and you'd like to try again or submit a new question, please return to the Ask a Pharmacist page at EverydayHealth. What are the side effects of Celebrex? Celebrex celecoxib belongs to the group of drugs known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs. It is used to treat pain or inflammation caused by conditions such as arthritis. According to the package insert, some of the most common side effects of Celebrex include upset stomach, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, dizziness, headache, skin rash, itching, blurred vision, and ringing of the ears.</p>
<p>Celebrex can also cause some serious side effects. Chronic use of Celebrex may cause an increased risk of life-threatening heart or circulation problems, which include heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>Celebrex can also cause high blood pressure and serious gastrointestinal events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine. To minimize the potential risk for a serious side effect, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest period of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. I would like your point of view on Celebrex. My mom was prescribed said medication and I am worried as to the numerous side effects it has.</p>
<p>Celebrex celecoxib is classified as a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug, and is COX-2 selective. It is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain, familial adenomatous polyposis and treatment of dysmenorrhea.</p>
<p>The lowest possible dose and shortest possible duration of time should be used in patients taking Celebrex. There are some serious warnings associated with the medication. These include cardiovascular, coronary, and gastrointestinal warnings.</p>
<p>NSAIDs non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs as a class have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. There is a theory that the risk may be increased with longer duration of use of this type of medication or if patients have a history of cardiovascular disease or risk factors.</p>
<p>The gastrointestinal warnings state that NSAIDs as a class can increase the risk of gastrointestinal irritation, ulceration, bleeding and perforation. Celebrex is contraindicated for treatment of pain after surgery of coronary artery bypass graft surgery due to increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p>
<p>This is not an inclusive list of all possible side effects of Celebrex. All medications have possible adverse effects associated with them. When deciding on an appropriate medication, the patient and the physician must weigh the benefit of the medication against the risks associated with it. There are many patient specific variables of your mother's that must be examined to determine if Celebrex is an appropriate treatment for her.</p>
<p>These variables include her medical conditions, other medications she is taking, overall health, etc. Her physician is best able to evaluate the possible risks specifically to your mother. Please have your mother or yourself speak with her physician regarding your concerns about the safety profile of Celebrex.</p>
<p>Jen Marsico, RPh Q: I take one Celebrex daily for knee arthritis. I am not overweight,exercise daily, and live a moderate lifestyle. Is there any other drug s I could take to help with knee stiffness? If you have osteoarthritis of the knee, you can take advantage of a wide range of treatment options. The effectiveness of different treatments varies from person to person and the choice of treatment should be a joint decision between you and your physician.</p>
<p>Exercises can help increase range of motion and flexibility as well as help strengthen the muscles in the leg. Physical therapy and exercise are often effective in reducing pain and improving function.</p>
<p>Your physician or a physical therapist can help develop an individualized exercise program that meets your needs and lifestyle. Several types of drugs can be used in treating arthritis of the knee. Because every patient is different, and because not all people respond the same to medications, your physician should be consulted on a program for your specific condition.</p>
<p>Glucosamine and chondroitin are oral supplements that may relieve the pain of osteoarthritis. These are two large molecules that are naturally found in the cartilage of our joints. These substances can help reduce swelling and tenderness, as well as improve mobility and function. If you decide to take this therapy, be aware that at least two months of continuous use is necessary before the full effect is realized. Although glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are natural substances, sometimes classified as food additives, they can cause side effects such as headaches, stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and skin reactions.</p>
<p>These supplements can interact with other medications, so keep your doctor informed about your use of them. I had prostate surgery in November  I also have rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>Whenever I take Celebrex for pain, it reduces urination frequency. Can you educate me, please. Is it good or bad? Celebrex celecoxib is frequently used to reduce pain caused by a variety of conditions. Usually, after prostate surgery the frequency of urination will increase. It is normally not a problem to reduce the frequency of urination with medication.</p>
<p>However, with Celebrex, you should notify your health care provider about the decrease in urinary frequency as this is listed as a more serious side effect of Celebrex. Anytime you notice changes in your daily routine, you should let your health care provider know. Sometimes, the changes will not matter and other times they may need to adjust your medication regimen. It is also good to keep a current list of any prescription medication and over-the-counter products you take and review it with your health care providers and your pharmacist.</p>
<p>If possible, use one pharmacy for all your prescription medications and over-the-counter products. This allows your pharmacist to keep a complete record of all your prescription drugs and to advise you about drug interactions and side effects. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action.</p>
<p>Megan Uehara, PharmD Q: My doctor prescribed Celebrex, but I can't afford it. What over-the-counter drug will relieve inflammation and pain? Celebrex is used to treat pain or inflammation caused by many conditions such as arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and menstrual pain.</p>
<p>It is also used in the treatment of hereditary polyps in the colon. However, they work slightly differently than Celebrex. Talk to your doctor to see if either of those medications would be appropriate for you and what dose you should take.</p>
<p>Your doctor is best able to guide your treatment choices based on your specific circumstances. Common side effects of NSAIDS include upset stomach, mild heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas, dizziness, nervousness, skin rash, blurred vision, and ringing in your ears.</p>
<p>The use of NSAIDS carries the risk of serious side effects, such as heart attack, stroke, and bleeding from your digestive tract. However, bleeding from the digestive tract can occur anytime during treatment. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or problems with vision or balance. Contact your doctor at once if you experience signs that you could be bleeding such as black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p>
<p>For more specific information, consult with your doctor or local pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Is it safe for me to take the Celebrex? What else can I take for the bursitis in my hip? Celecoxib is also used in the treatment of hereditary polyps in the colon.</p>
<p>Common side effects of Celebrex include upset stomach, mild heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas, dizziness, nervousness, headache, skin rash, itching, blurred vision, and ringing in your ears. More serious side effects can occur and this is not a complete list of possible side effects associated with Celebrex. Using Celebrex increases the risk of serious conditions involving the stomach and intestines, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation forming a hole in the wall of the stomach or intestines.</p>
<p>These conditions can be life-threatening and can occur without warning at any time during treatment with Celebrex. Because of this risk, people with a history of stomach ulcers or bleeding should not use Celebrex. The risk is also increased in elderly patients over the age of 65 and with longer duration of therapy.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the safety of Celebrex use, talk to your doctor for information based on your specific circumstances. Contact your doctor right away if you have symptoms of bleeding from your digestive tract. These include black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or local pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications.</p>
<p>Sarah Lewis, RPh Q: Over the past year, I have gained about 25 lbs, with excess "flab" around the midsection and a stomach I've never had to deal with before. I started taking Celebrex daily for over a year thinking it was better for me than taking mg of ibuprofen everyday. I'm really struggling with my weight.</p>
<p>Has the Celebrex caused "some" of my weight gain? Drugs can cause weight gain in several different ways. Some can increase appetite or make you crave certain types of foods like those high in carbohydrates or fat.</p>
<p>Other medications may slow down metabolism or cause fluid retention. However, the effect of prescription drugs on body weight is complex. Some drugs have no effect on weight, while others cause weight gain or weight loss.</p>
<p>Also, the same medications can cause weight gain in certain individuals and weight loss in others. It may increase your risk of stomach bleeding. Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any cold, allergy, or pain medication. Many medicines available over the counter contain aspirin or other medicines similar to celecoxib. Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much of this type of medication. Check the label to see if a medicine contains aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, or naproxen.</p>
<p>Celebrex side effects Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Celebrex: Get emergency medical help if you have signs of a heart attack or stroke: Stop using Celebrex and call your doctor at once if you have: Common Celebrex side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.</p>
<p>Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. Celebrex dosing information Usual Adult Dose for Pain: Then, mg twice daily as needed. Usual Adult Dose for Dysmenorrhea: Usual Adult Dose for Osteoarthritis: Usual Adult Dose for Rheumatoid Arthritis: Usual Adult Dose for Ankylosing Spondylitis: If after 6 weeks of therapy no results are observed, a trial dose of mg orally daily may be worthwhile.</p>
<p>If no response is seen after 6 weeks, consideration should be given to alternate treatment options. Ask your doctor before using Celebrex if you take an antidepressant such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine Prozac , fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline Zoloft , trazodone, or vilazodone.
