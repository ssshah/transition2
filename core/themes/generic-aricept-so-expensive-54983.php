		<p><p>However, the differences between active treatments were not statistically significant. The duration of this placebo washout period was not sufficient to characterize the rate of loss of the treatment effect, but the week study see above demonstrated that treatment effects associated with the use of ARICEPT abate within 6 weeks of treatment discontinuation.</p>
<p>Figure 5 illustrates the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the three treatment groups who attained the measure of improvement in ADAS-cog score shown on the X axis. The same three change scores 7-point and 4-point reductions from baseline or no change in score as selected for the week study have been used for this illustration.</p>
<p>The percentages of patients achieving those results are shown in the inset table. As observed in the week study, the curves demonstrate that patients assigned to either placebo or to ARICEPT have a wide range of responses, but that the ARICEPT treated patients are more likely to show greater improvements in cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Effects on the CIBIC-plus Figure 6 is a histogram of the frequency distribution of CIBIC-plus scores attained by patients assigned to each of the three treatment groups who completed 12 weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>At the end of the 6 month treatment period,  The mean age of patients was  Almost all patients were Caucasian. Study Outcome Measures The effectiveness of treatment with ARICEPT was determined using a dual outcome assessment strategy that evaluated cognitive function using an instrument designed for more impaired patients and overall function through caregiver-rated assessment.</p>
<p>The SIB, a multi-item instrument, has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. The SIB evaluates selective aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, language, orientation, attention, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, and social interaction.</p>
<p>The SIB scoring range is from 0 to , with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Each ADL item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss. The investigator performs the inventory by interviewing a caregiver, in this study a nurse staff member, familiar with the functioning of the patient.</p>
<p>Effects on the SIB Figure 7 shows the time course for the change from baseline in SIB score for the two treatment groups over the 6 months of the study.</p>
<p>Figure 8 illustrates the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the two treatment groups who attained the measure of improvement in SIB score shown on the X-axis. Figure 10 shows the cumulative percentages of patients from each treatment group with specified changes from baseline ADCS-ADL-severe scores.</p>
<p>Two hundred and forty eight patients completed the study, with similar proportions of patients completing the study in each treatment group. The CIBIC-plus used in this trial was a semi-structured instrument that examines four major areas of patient function: Figure 12 illustrates the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the two treatment groups who attained the measure of improvement in SIB score shown on the X-axis.</p>

<p>Care is also needed in pregnancy and lactating women should stop breast feeding at the time of admission. The individual effects specially on performance in motor vehicles and other machinery need to be evaluated by a doctor.</p>
<p>Dosage Treatment should be started at a dose of 5 mg daily single dose. Please Note the Following. If you are on Medicare, many times when you purchase a medication you pay nothing or a small co-pay.</p>
<p>Most people are under the illusion that this is the cost that is credited to their Medicare account. The is far from the truth. This is exactly what happens to Dotty for a 30 day supply of Namenda from Costco. What you want to know when you purchase a drug is what you pay, and what your plan pays in this example Medicare , this is the cost being applied to the Medicare Donut hole. You may or may not reach the Medicare Donut hole this year.</p>
<p>If not, as soon as your start taking a high priced medication you can get there very quickly. We have never had a problem with a generic alternative medications.</p>
<p>Apparently, the meds do not work for some people, but I am fortunate that there are such drugs that can improve the quality of our lives in these not so golden years. He will be 94 next March and I am doing everything I can to make his days comfortable and pleasant.</p>
<p>It has aged me alot, but tomorrow we will be married 52 years and I am grateful for our memories. As our son says, "it is what it is" Thanks Pioneer but my mom was taking it even before she had any real signs of Dimensia as a precaution by doctors orders and even after 5 years she deteriorated quickly not being able to talk the last 2 years and lately her ability to walk also was going by the wayside.</p>
<p>In fact the day she fell I was trying to help her with a walker. So in fact Aricept and Namenda work for some but for my mom, although it most likely prolonged things, she never had the results that your husband has. God Bless you both and I hope he is with you for many more years. I have no regrets with my mom. I did the best I could. My mother also became very ill; however, it didn't hit her until days later and no one suspected the Aricept immediately. She ended up in the hospital for 7 days with a torn esophagus from her vomiting so violently for 4 days.</p>
<p>Poor woman suffered so badly. Anyway, it was eliminated from her pill regiment and she was better in a week or so. Next we tried Razadyne and the Aricept patch with the same results for both. Lastly, we put her on Excelon which seems to agree with her system. BUT now I'm wondering if it is doing any good or just wasting her money. She's also on Namenda which she's always been able to tolerate but again, is it doing her any good?</p>
<p>I recently heard of a study that says all these drugs are absolutely not helping the way the drug "scientists" had hoped so my question: Should she still be on both or either one??? Hello MargieB, Thank you very much for your comment. If you'd like to ask a new question, you can do so here: Emily Community Manager Newshound answered Aricept and Namenda take time to start working, I think you have to give it at least a month unless there are serious side effects.</p>
<p>They all have effects at first that lessen over time. I was upset that my long distance caregiver I was 3 hours away took my Dad off Namenda without asking me, they asked the dr who I don't like anyway. They thought he couldn't afford it, but that wasn't true. I don't know if that was what affected him or not, he did get worse a couple months later. Like it can take a month or two to see it work, could it take a month or two to see worsening effects of taking someone off of it?</p>
<p>It's been a year he's been off it, he's on 10mg Aricept also. The dr also tried to put him up to mg Zoloft in January and I noticed right away him having communication problems and bad delusions. I made him put it bad to  What made the best difference though was when I was able to finally get him to a nice assisted care facility near me. He was only getting caregivers 4 hours a day. When they were gone I'm sure he was afraid and was having hallucinations and delusions that upset him.</p>
<p>Getting him moved reduced the hallucinations to practically nothing not drugs! The right place makes a world of difference. He chose 2 years ago not to get a heart valve replaced. But I would never take the heart meds away, I would hate for him to have a stroke and live through it Heart surgery would probably advance his Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Why have the heart ok but no memory of anyone any more, or be able to function otherwise? He did have shoulder surgery after a fall 2 years ago because that would have limited his current functioning. But I am finding any time he is in the hospital he gets delirium now, and I will avoid that as much as possible. He needs a pacemaker battery soon, but they do them outpatient now, I would not withhold that from him. But I would not do cancer surgery or chemo if that was his problem I think I would rather have discontinued the Aricept and kept him on the Namenda, but he seems to be doing well right now so I'm not going to mess with it Two years in a row he broke bones, shoulder, then femur that didn't need surgery but he was wheelchair and rehab bound very boring and he went downhill during.</p>
<p>The dr put him on it and he fell a bunch more times 6 months later and never broke another bone. Breaking bones are the worst thing for seniors and if you can prevent that it's great.</p>
<p>That pill definitely worked. The falls were from being alone and not exercising and eating and getting meds right, assisted care has helped with that, he hasn't fallen since and gets pt and plenty of room to walk on his own. This is a followup to one of my comments a few months ago.</p>
<p>His dimentia is hardly noticeable now. Family and friends who have visited us this summer can see a world of difference from a year ago. He is interested in politics again, reading, writing and working on crossword puzzles We are truly blessed.</p>
<p>I will never take him off these drugs. He will be 94 in a few months. Namenda and Exelon works for my mom. She is in mid-stage. She has been on Exelon 2 yrs before Namenda, no special benefit. But when she started taking Namenda, there was tremendous improvement, much more alert, even her incontinence got better. This also has a lot to do with my one-on-one care for her at home vs. I brought her home and cared for her at home.</p>
<p>Namenda kept her from deteriorating for 4 yrs. Now, I see a slight change, but she is still doing well. I believe Namenda has a lot to do with it. Several caregivers at the various support group I attended over 4 yrs also reported marked improvement in their loved ones. I am an internist, geriatrician and Hospice doctor, so I have been working with AD patients and families for about 30 years now.</p>
<p>The answers above really reflect the variety of responses people have to these drugs. In general, the most benefit is gained in the early stages. The benefit tends to be modest in most cases; sometimes, it is more striking.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is no perceptible benefit at all. I would say if your family member has responded well and seems to be stable and enjoying a good quality of life, keep them on the meds. If they have immediate side effects, like nausea or diarrhea from Aricept or hallucinations from Namenda, stop the drug.</p>
<p>If they have progressed to late stages where they are dependent in all ADL's, no longer communicate, and are starting to have trouble swallowing then stop the drugs. I have literally never seen any benefit in a patient this advanced or any harm from stopping the meds.</p>
<p>The money would be better spent elsewhere, like on a home health aide to give the caregiver a break. As for treating cancers, kidney failure and heart issues, please don't even think about it. God is offering the sufferer a way out of their failing brain and body, don't torture the poor person with painful testing or treatments they can't understand just so they can go on to die of aspiration pneumonia and decubitis ulcers.</p>
<p>Hospice is a great option for patients who are in the last stages and will provide help with meds and equipment, skilled and compassionate nurses, HHA services, social work and spiritual support. After finding a price chart on the Alzheimer's Assn, I began calling around. Interestingly, the cost of Aracept around the U. Best wishes to everyone who is helping their parents - it's not easy. That's why we need and appreciate sites like this. As a part-time, non-family caregiver for one precious lady for almost two years, my prayers and heart go out to all.</p>
<p>I think "geriatrician" very adequately sums it up. I would like to add--it is ABOLUTELY imperative that, when talking to your loved one's medical professionals, you have full disclosure--the nature of any falls, every single thing so that they can make a good plan of care.</p>
<p>Also, tell them that you are worn out too. In my situation, the spouse of the child of the Alzheimers lady did not present the facts and the hospice nurse, upon her initial intake, immediately discontinued Exelon Patch and Namenda. I am not sure the spouse was aware of all the facts; as well as being tired and worried about their entire youngish family and is trying to look at the big picture--i. I cannot be certain at all that her decline is a progression of this disease, as the hospice nurse feels it is.</p>
<p>There are too many other factors that may have made it appear as disease progression--'catastrophic events', one right after another, that my lady's body was contending with--two falls, unrelated to the disease progression, as well as her adult child being drastically absent from her care.</p>
<p>I am not advocating 'prolonging' her or anyone else's suffering in this or any disease, but I am also concerned about her quality of life. She has become very, very agitated and incapable since--which it is being handled by adding anti-anxiety meds--in her case, when they wear off, she appears to be even worse. I just do not know, but I hate it.</p>
<p>My education level is not to the level of the trusted family doctor as well as the hospice company coming in, plus I have been a 'family friend' for years. When I am there, I will continue to hold her hand and do the best by her, trying to give her 'moments of joy'.</p>
<p>I do wholeheartedly recommend that book, Creating Moments of Joy by Jolene Brackey, to everyone that has to deal with someone with Alzheimers and any related dementia issue. Thank you one and all for walking through this very difficult time in your loved one's life with them, and for caring.</p>
<p>Aricept gave her such vivid, horrible dreams that she would cry for hours upon wakening. Namenda made her so confused, it was pointless. Exelon caused her to lose 16 pounds in two months. We notice no difference in her behavior since being off the meds. Three years ago, I became the full-time caregiver for my mother who will be 94 in a few months. She ran out of money for Assisted Care. I talked to the Doctor and the Pharmacist and no one would actually say to take her off of it. They said if she needed to go back on, it wouldn't be as affective.</p>
<p>As affective as what? The only thing Aricept did for my mother was give her nightmares. I stopped it and she is doing great two years later. I have a couple of volunteers and family members who visit weekly and we do a lot of puzzles, word searches, the Knifty Knitter, etc. I think this one-on-one activity is the greatest benefit of all for her mind.</p>
<p>She never watches TV which is usually all they provide in care facilities. My mom has been on Namenda for a period of six months and did not do very well. I have decided to let nature take its course. My mom had a very bad reaction to Namenda. She hallucinated and was combative and she had no appetite. She also did not sleep well. I did contemplate a combination of Namenda and Aricept and decided that because my mom is in the middle 7 stage she would be better off if she does not take any meds except for her high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>
<p>She is still capable of some basic task like brushing her teeth, eating, showering and dressing herself. I would like some feedback on "melatonin".</p>
<p>Has anyone tried to as a sleep aid for patients with Dementia? It works VERY fast on me - 5 mg. As far as a dementia patient, my mom uses melatonin same dosage and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I've even doubled it a few times - just to help her get to sleep. When I do, she sleeps soundly and well all night. When she takes the single dose, it's a crap shoot But since it's a natural product, I don't feel bad about doubling it occasionally a couple of times a month Won't know til you try.</p>
<p>Along with his Physicians approval, we recently stopped the Aricept. It has been 2 weeks now and we have seen slower movement and a bit more forget-fullness. Is it due to the recent stoppage of the medicine or recent decline? What I do ponder is why are we so afraid to let nature takes it coarse? This man is a walking, ticking, time bomb waiting to go off from numerous different ailments. We are not stopping any of his cardiac or diabetic meds because we do believe in symptom control.</p>
<p>It is all so frustrating and confusing. FIL has 2 other sons besides my husbands that are both wrapped up in their own lives. One of them comes by almost every weekend but doesnt truly get what its like to be a 24 hr caregiver.</p>
<p>I often become upset when he talks about all the fun things he gets to do without having to worry about what he is going to do with his dad. The other son is of no help at all and doesnt even call or visit Alzheimers is so cruel and long lasting.</p>
<p>Shoving pills down someone to prolong a terrible illness seems so cruel. Would you be happy? Would you be happy to know that you wont recognize your children or maybe even your spouse? The hurt that comes to the loved ones who care for these individuals can be so taxing and detrimental to our own health.</p>
<p>My mom has been on aricept and many other drugs since  She hardly recognizes me or any family member. We decided to remove all drugs high blood pressure, diuretic, anit anxiety, etc.</p>
<p>She also just went on hospice 4 weeks ago. She is improving believe it or not. She actually knew me and that my birthday was coming up yesterday. Here we thought we were killing her and she is improving.</p>
<p>The specialists say she just may feel better without all the meds and that sooner or later she will crash. If she does, at least she had a few weeks knowing us and feeling better. My mother has mid stage Dementia. The neurologist believes it's mixed causes. Aricept and Namenda have made a huge difference.</p>
<p>She ramped up slowly over about 2 months between both meds, and while she has had some diarrhea it wasn't a big problem. She does have vivid dreams but usually she enjoys them. Only once did she complain of a nightmare. She remembers important events for the most part, and is definitely far more alert, interested and engaged.</p>
<p>The problem I have now is that she has enough cognitive functioning that she feels she should take care of herself and go home and be "normal. She does not understand there is a new normal. The medication is definitely working, and many days there is a positive impact. Her home is very isolated, and she does not believe she needs a caregiver there.</p>
<p>She is making herself, me and her other children miserable. The drugs are a real mixed blessing for us. My mother is in mid-stage dementia and has been on Namenda for approximately 3. She has greatly improved, and although there could be other contributing factors to her improvement, I have to assume that the medicine is a part of it.</p>
<p>Maybe its not, but it could be, and the reward of her quality of life greatly outweighs any risk. Her doctor recently informed me what most everyone here is saying, that at some point the medication will no longer help. I think when it gets to that point it will be obvious that she is beyond help, and at that point I will stop the medication maybe.</p>
<p>My mom doesn't always remember who I am, and recently asked me what her own name is. Sometimes she speaks what sounds like gibberish, other times she is extremely lucid and clear.</p>
<p>A different doctor recently advised taking my mom off of Namenda because she fell and injured herself severely, and the doctor says Namenda increases fall risk. My mother's primary doctor will advise me of her recommendation, and with all of that information, plus what I have researched myself, family feedback and God's guidance I will make the final decision, not a doctor.</p>
<p>Doctors only make an educated guess; its a very educated guess, but its still a guess and they don't KNOW and are not always right. In my experience, insurance and sometimes doctors are all too quick to throw your loved one away like trash. If we don't do the research ourselves, find out about the best options ourselves, consult other knowledgeable people, get feedback from family, ask GOD for help and guidance and advocate tirelessly for our loved one we might as well throw our loved one away too.</p>
<p>Doctors have their opinions, but at the end of the day, my mom is just a number, a body taking up space in their hospital, taking up their time and money. I love her, and I'm going to be the one to decide if the doctor's educated guess lines up with what I believe will result in my mom's highest quality of life. My other two-cents, about end of life, is that a sudden heart attack is the way to go. I hope my mom's heart stops before she declines further to the end stages.</p>
<p>If you have a loved one die suddenly, believe it or not, you are extremely fortunate. Getting the chance to say goodbye is not all its cracked up to be. Seeing my highly intelligent, very well-educated mother slowly decline mentally is beyond torture, its like living in absolute hell every single day. Its stressful, its depressing, and when I think about it I just feel this overwhelming feeling of anguish and restlessness because I am completely helpless and powerless to do anything to stop this suffering.</p>
<p>I also watched my father slowly die of cancer. It's sheer hell on earth. To anyone that lost a loved one suddenly, be consoled, because I would much much rather have lost the chance to say goodbye than to watch someone I love so dearly slowly die.</p>
<p>Experiencing this pain is my reminder that we live in a fallen world, where death and disease reign. When we pass from this world into the afterlife, if our faith and hope is in Jesus Christ we will live forever in Heaven; no more disease, no more suffering, no more tears, and no more goodbyes. My Mother in law has been on Aricept for about 4 years for mild alzhiemers.. I was told when she first started on Aricept it was not meant to be a long term drug Namenda does not do anything at all, in fact my Mother was put on Namenda, and after about 6 weeks we took her off of it..</p></p>

Almost immediately after stopping the aricept, the incontinence stopped. But our family has an additional wrinkle: If anyone is now playing 'God', it's the health care service that 'preserves life' in direct conflict with the admonission to "do no harm. She remembers myself, but only part of the time and she does not remember my brother, or rest of the family at all. After finding a price chart on the Alzheimer's Assn, I began calling around. She does not understand there is a new normal. Should I be alarmed or should I laugh.
