Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia , prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment.</p>
<p>While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Pseudo-parkinsonism Symptoms may include: Reassurance and sedation are important. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled when an anti-parkinson- ism agent is administered concomitantly.</p>
<p>Antiparkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally, therapy of a few weeks to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. Levodopa has not been found effective in pseudo-parkinsonism. Occasionally it is nec- essary to lower the dosage of prochlorperazine or to discontinue the drug. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued.</p>
<p>The syndrome can also develop, although much less frequently, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of neuroleptic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.</p>
<p>The symptoms are persis- tent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw e.</p></p>
