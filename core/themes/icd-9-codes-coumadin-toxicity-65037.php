		<p><p>We recently had a difficult case regarding a query for acute renal failure. Here is the scenario: An year-old woman came into the emergency room ER because she ran into the bumper of a car while driving her electric scooter and sustained a laceration to her leg.</p>
<p>She had a history of mechanical valve replacement years ago, and a history of liver disease. Although she had been on 1 milligram mg of Coumadin three times a week, she had been to her doctor the day before.</p>
<p>In the ER, they sutured her laceration. She continued to bleed from the laceration and was admitted for administration of fresh frozen plasma FFP. Her liver enzymes were also elevated on admission. Sadly the woman developed acute-on-chronic liver failure and died. The discharge summary states acute-on-chronic liver failure. We are having trouble identifying the principal diagnosis. The attending was been otherwise silent about the diagnosis.</p>
<p>In this instance, without seeing the complete record, I believe some documentation might be missing. I would be interested in knowing from a documentation improvement standpoint especially in light of new guidelines for ICDCM reporting as well as from a clinical one, if she was taking the Coumadin as prescribed.</p>
<p>She was treated in the ER for the laceration. Typically, a patient would not be admitted as an inpatient for such a wound, so I disagree with the idea that she was admitted for the laceration. The laceration was treated and resolved in the outpatient setting e.</p>
<p>Since the condition after study that occasioned the admission is the principal diagnosis, we need to determine the cause of the bleeding.</p>
<p>Circulating anticoagulants are usually autoantibodies that fight against the normal clotting mechanism and neutralize specific clotting factors. This condition is not caused by a prescribed anticoagulant drug.</p>
<p>Anticoagulant agents such as Coumadin are not circulating anticoagulants. Patients who are on a prescribed anticoagulant drug to prevent the formation of blood clots may develop bleeding or hemorrhaging. If a hemorrhage develops that is related to an adverse effect of an anticoagulant drug such as Coumadin, code the hemorrhagic condition first followed by E It is important to note that it should not be assumed that the adverse effect is drug related unless it is documented by the physician.</p>
<p>The differences in reimbursement between cases admitted with adverse effects of coagulants and a coagulation defect is significant.</p>
<p>For example, if a Medicare patient is admitted for treatment of GI bleeding due to anticoagulant use and the principal diagnosis is  But when code  Coding professionals should reference the following AHA Coding Clinics as a refresher on this code assignment: Third quarter , page 14 Third quarter , page 15 Fourth quarter , volume 29, Number 5 page 16 Third quarter , page 7 Second quarter Q page 17 Test your knowledge with the following questions Questions 1: A patient is admitted with atrial fibrillation and is put on Coumadin.</p>
<p>The patient develops epistaxis due to Coumadin while in the hospital. At discharge the physician documents atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, epistaxis and adverse reaction to Coumadin. What is the appropriate diagnosis code assignment s for this case?</p>
<p>A patient on Coumadin therapy is admitted after vomiting blood secondary to gastritis. The patient's gastritis was evaluated and treated. Coding Clinic is published quarterly by the American Hospital Association.</p></p>
