		<p><p>But virtually everyone with IC has pain associated with bladder filling and emptying. Some women with IC have a constant need to urinate, because urinating helps relieve the pain. In women who also have chronic abdominal or pelvic pain from other causes, such as irritable bowel syndrome or endometriosis, IC may flare up when those symptoms are at their worst. Sexual intercourse can trigger pain lasting several days, and symptoms may worsen with menstruation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some women experience complete relief during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Some find that their symptoms are worse after consuming certain foods or drinks, including strawberries, oranges, tomatoes, chocolate, spices, caffeine, alcohol, and beverages that acidify the urine, such as cranberry juice.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of exclusion IC is not a urinary tract infection, and it can't be identified by a simple urinalysis or urine culture. Rather, it's a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that it's diagnosed only after a number of other conditions have been ruled out. A clinician — usually a urologist or a gynecologist — will first take a thorough history, then conduct a physical exam including a pelvic exam, if it's not too uncomfortable and perform tests for infection, bladder stones, bladder cancer, kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, endometriosis, sexually transmitted diseases, and other disorders.</p>
<p>The AUA guidelines also recommend an early assessment of pain, urinary frequency, and urine volume, to help evaluate the effectiveness of later treatments. If a diagnosis is uncertain or there are symptoms such as blood in the urine that suggest other problems, the next step is usually cystoscopy, which involves inserting a fiber-optic tube through the urethra to look at the bladder wall.</p>
<p>During the procedure, a tissue sample may be taken to rule out bladder cancer. Some clinicians favor hydrodistention under local or regional anesthesia, which involves filling the bladder during cystoscopy with a liquid that stretches it, providing a closer view of the bladder wall. However, AUA guidelines do not recommend hydrodistention for either diagnosis or treatment. In people with IC, glomerulations — tiny pinpoint spots of blood — are usually visible on the bladder wall during cystoscopy with hydrodistention, but these lesions are often seen within the normal bladder as well.</p>
<p>I have been having negative urine tests thinking I had ITU. Went to a urologist and told me about IC. He really did nothing for me. I found a very experienced urologist that deals only with IC.</p>
<p>Because I have Hunner's ulcers I have kenalog injections when an ulcer is present other wise I am on 10mlg of elavil nightly. Works very well for sleeping and less trips to the bathroom at night. Because of the weight gain I do belong to a weight loss group to help me stay away from gaining weight.</p>
<p>Positives - it's still working and at the low dose of 10mg. Issues - beginning to think I'm indestructible and after having tea and wine, I had a flare. However, the flare only lasted a day and I wasn't crying in pain. Still working for IC but weirdly more unpleasant side effects, drowsiness, dry mouth and zombified feeling in morning. The difference was pretty immediate so I'm sure it's that. Perhaps other users should take note of brands.</p>
<p>Hydrodistention Hydrodistention under general anesthesia is often used during diagnosis, but it also can have short-term therapeutic benefit in up to 50 percent of patients. The bladder is emptied and refilled to allow the urologist to look for lesions or ulceration.</p>
<p>The urologist then distends the bladder again for eight minutes. The bladder is emptied again, at which time the urologist may take a biopsy specimen. As previously mentioned, about half of patients experience some relief of symptoms after distention, but relief rarely lasts longer than six months.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the procedure causes increased bladder capacity and interference with pain signals transmitted via nerves in the bladder. The purpose of surgery is to increase the functional capacity of the bladder or to divert the urine stream. Unfortunately, even with removal of the bladder, some patients may continue to experience pelvic pain, possibly due to pelvic floor spasm or central nervous system-mediated pain.</p>
<p>Referral to a specialist is recommended, however, if: Interstitial Cystitis and Diet. Interstitial Cystitis Association;  Effect of comestibles on symptoms of interstitial cystitis.</p>
