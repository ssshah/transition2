		<p><p>It was strange because I could hear myself crying out, but I felt like I was watching the whole scene from slightly above my own body. My friend was very worried but I couldn't even talk to him. I headed down the hallway to the bathroom in the dorm corridor, and it felt eerily like the scene from requiem where the girl is walking down the hallway and everything is distorted and she looks really scared and out of it.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, I started puking my guts out. The pain in my chest was so excruciating that I knew I was dying. I knew I was going to die with a scary certainty, but throughout it all my mind was very calm and accepting of what was happening. But obviously I didn't die. I somehow managed to get back to my room where my friend was extremely distraught. I finally was able to tell him I really wanted to go to the ER, but I was too worried about ruining my life. As my body started to calm down, still in a lot of pain and throwing up, I called my friends who are very very experienced with drugs, and they said definitely not to go to the ER, because it appeared I was not going to die anymore.</p>
<p>I am constantly around scheduled drugs because of my research, and though I never have and never would steal any because it's not worth losing my future and my reputation , I certainly wouldn't want it known in my field that I do experiment with drugs.</p>
<p>You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual doses of Codeine Phosphate Tablets are as follows: Adults To relieve pain mg every 6 hours or more, as required. If necessary, up to mg daily. To prevent coughing mg 3 or 4 times daily.</p>
<p>To treat chronic diarrhoea mg 3 or 4 times daily. The dose maybe reduced for elderly patients. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. However, codeine is available without prescription from licensed pharmacists in doses up to 0. Schedule 1, Part IV, paragraph 23 i. Section 3, 1 a India[ edit ] Codeine preparations require a prescription in India.</p>
<p>A preparation of paracetamol and codeine is available in India. Codeine is also present in various cough syrups as codeine phosphate including chlorpheniramine maleate. Pure codeine is also available as codeine sulphate tablets. Codeine containing cough medicine has been banned in India with effect from 14 March  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has found no proof of its efficacy against cough control.</p>
<p>Iran's deputy health minister reported that codeine combinations is Iran's best selling OTC medication. Codeine remains a semi non-prescriptive, over-the-counter drug up to a limit of  This medicine can impair cognitive function and can affect a patient's ability to drive safely. This class of medicine is in the list of drugs included in regulations under 5a of the Road Traffic Act  When prescribing this medicine, patients should be told: Symptoms may include tremor, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, depression, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, yawning, piloerection, mydriasis, weakness, pyrexia, muscle cramps, dehydration, and increase in heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p>NOTE - tolerance diminishes rapidly after withdrawal so a previously tolerated dose may prove fatal. Symptoms of restlessness and irritability may result when treatment is then stopped. First, I break them in half, then I add about 90ml of tap water. The tablets usually dissolve after about 10 minutes with occasional stirring. Some brands tend to dissolve and filter much faster than others so I make to sure to stick with those brands.</p>
<p>Why make things harder, right? Once they are dissolved, I stick it in the freezer until ice just starts to form on top. Next, I take two coffee filters and fold the edges of one so that it fits neatly into the other.</p>
<p>I wet them with ice-water and put them over the top of a small plastic cup. Once the hour is up I neatly fold up the edges of the filters and slowly and very carefully squeeze the living hell out of the filter and it's contents.</p>
<p>This is to ensure that I get every last bit of opiate goodness. I made sure I had taken no drugs within 24hrs earlier to the event.</p>
<p>As a side note I do smoke, about a pack a day, from what I recall this does have an affect on recreational use on drugs, generally making the high or buzz last a little shorter compared to a non smoker; specifically in this case of codeine.</p>
<p>Not so much as to make it worthless at all, just in comparison. Now, with a clear mindset, and a decent, mellow setting, I began my little adventure.</p>
<p>I crushed 5 Tylenol 3's into a coarse powder, mixed it well into an 8ounce glass of water with some orange flavoring, and chugged it down. Very bitter taste as one might imagine. Crushing the pills would allow for faster absorption.</p>
<p>I proceeded to add another 2ounces of water to the cup and drank what was there in case I missed any of the sediment.</p></p>
