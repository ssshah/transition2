            <h1>Methods abusing vicodin - Short-term Effects of Vicodin Abuse</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Teens may not fully appreciate the addictive and dangerous properties of these pills, especially when taken without the benefit of doctor supervision. As with all drugs, education is the best way to prevent abuse, and steps you can take to warn your teen about the perils of hydrocodone include: Discussing the possible consequences of abusing any drugâ€”prescription or otherwise. Teens may not appreciate the addictive potential and dangerous effects of prescription drugs, so ensure they receive drug abuse information on pills as well as street drugs.</p>
<p>Sudden alterations in habits, friends, or attitude may be red flags for substance abuse. As a depressant of the central nervous system, when someone is on Vicodin it decreases their heart rate and respiratory system, and abuse of this drug can lead to the likelihood of an overdose occurring. Snorting Vicodin One of the more common ways to misuse Vicodin is to crush up the medicine and snort it. When someone who is on Vicodin snorts the drug, they get the hydrocodone quickly, and it tends to be very potent.</p>
<p>Snorting Vicodin also tends to lead to a faster dependency on the drug, as opposed to taking it by mouth. Snorting Vicodin leads it to enter the bloodstream much faster than it would otherwise, so rather than taking around thirty minutes to take effect, the effects of being on Vicodin will begin in about three minutes.</p>
<p>When do you know if someone has moved from being on Vicodin for a legitimate medical reason to abusing the drug? Initially, some of the emotional signs of being on Vicodin include euphoria, but also potentially mood swings and anxiety. Other physical signs someone is on Vicodin can include lack of concentration and focus, dizziness, weakness, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, headache, ringing in the ears and small pupils.</p>
<p>Detox and Withdrawal Vicodin is the brand name combination of hydrocodone and acetaminophen, which is an over-the-counter pain reliever, commonly sold under the brand name Tylenol. Vicodin typically relieves pain for up to six hours, and medical professionals often prescribe this pain reliever for patients after surgery. Like any opioid pain medication, Vicodin can be addictive , and some patients build a tolerance to it.</p>
<p>This means that the individual takes larger doses of Vicodin or does so compulsively without being able to stop. Physical dependence means that individuals will experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking the medication. Unlike other opioid pain relievers, Vicodin can be especially dangerous for the liver. Large doses of acetaminophen were found to cause severe allergic reactions and liver damage in many people, and several people who took over mg of acetaminophen consistently often ended up in the emergency room due to overdose.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration changed their guidelines on acetaminophen products in , especially on the amount of acetaminophen that can be used in prescription painkillers like Percocet oxycodone and Vicodin hydrocodone. The limit was placed at mg, but individuals taking these painkillers should also be wary of acetaminophen in over-the-counter cold and flu medications, to prevent overdose.</p>
<p>Vicodin Withdrawal Symptoms Vicodin withdrawal symptoms are similar to those of other opioid pain medications. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets and observed closely.</p>
<p>Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in nonambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down. Other adverse reactions include: Central Nervous System Drowsiness, mental clouding, lethargy, impairment of mental and physical performance, anxiety, fear, dysphoria, psychic dependence, mood changes.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal System Prolonged administration of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets may produce constipation. Genitourinary System Ureteral spasm, spasm of vesical sphincters and urinary retention have been reported with opiates. Special Senses Cases of hearing impairment or permanent loss have been reported predominantly in patients with chronic overdose.</p>
<p>Dermatological Skin rash, pruritus. The following adverse drug events may be borne in mind as potential effects of acetaminophen: Drug Abuse and Dependence Hydrocone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance. Abuse and Dependence Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of narcotics; therefore, this product should be prescribed and administered with caution.</p>
<p>However, psychic dependence is unlikely to develop when hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets are used for a short time for the treatment of pain.</p>
<p>Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued narcotic use, although some mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of narcotic therapy.</p>
<p>Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia, is manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients.</p>
<p>Overdosage Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from hydrocodone or acetaminophen. Signs and Symptoms Hydrocodone: In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur.</p>
<p>Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and coagulation defects may also occur. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: There were also 82, ER visits associated with Hydrocodone use reported in  Teens have been found to be especially common in terms of Hydrocodone abuse, primary Vicodin.</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons teens may be more likely to use Hydrocodone than Oxycodone or street drugs. It is often assumed that prescription medications are safer than illicit drugs because doctors give them to patients for the management of disease.</p>
<p>This is a false assumption, since many prescription medications are stronger and more dangerous than illicit drugs when abused. In addition, young professionals, college students, and veterans â€” especially combat veterans â€” are susceptible to Hydrocodone abuse and addiction.</p></p>
