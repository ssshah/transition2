            <h1>Cardizem tablet 30 mg</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Petechiae, photosensitivity, pruritus, urticaria Other: Amblyopia, CPK elevation, dry mouth, dyspnea, epistaxis, eye irritation, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, impotence, muscle cramps, nasal congestion, nocturia, osteoarticular pain, polyuria, sexual difficulties, tinnitus The following postmarketing events have been reported infrequently in patients receiving Cardizem: There have been observed cases of a generalized rash, some characterized as leukocytoclastic vasculitis.</p>
<p>In addition, events such as myocardial infarction have been observed, which are not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. A definitive cause and effect relationship between these events and Cardizem therapy cannot yet be established.</p>
<p>Exfoliative dermatitis proven by rechallenge has also been reported. The toxic dose in man is not known. Due to extensive metabolism, blood levels after a standard dose of diltiazem can vary over tenfold, limiting the usefulness of blood levels in overdose cases. Of cases with known outcome, most patients recovered and in cases with a fatal outcome, the majority involved multiple drug ingestion.</p>
<p>Events observed following diltiazem overdose included bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, and cardiac failure. Bradycardia frequently responded favorably to atropine, as did heart block, although cardiac pacing was also frequently utilized to treat heart block.</p>
<p>Fluids and vasopressors were used to maintain blood pressure, and in cases of cardiac failure, inotropic agents were administered. The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium.</p>
<p>In some cases intravenous calcium has been administered 1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours.</p>
<p>Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia. In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination.</p>
<p>Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously. Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing. Administer inotropic agents isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine and diuretics. Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.</p>
<p>Dosage must be adjusted to each patient's needs. When possible, use a non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin together with diltiazem; otherwise, dose adjustments for both diltiazem and the statin should be considered along with close monitoring for signs and symptoms of any statin related adverse events. Subjects with increased average steady-state exposures of diltiazem showed a greater fold increase in simvastatin exposure.</p>
<p>Computer-based simulations showed that at a daily dose of mg of diltiazem, an 8-to 9-fold mean increase in simvastatin AUC can be expected. If co-administration of simvastatin with diltiazem is required, limit the daily doses of simvastatin to 10 mg and diltiazem to mg.</p>
<p>In a ten-subject randomized, open label, 4-way cross-over study, co-administration of diltiazem mg BID diltiazem SR for 2 weeks with a single 20 mg dose of lovastatin resulted in 3-to 4-fold increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax versus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and Cmax during diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin. This effect may rarely result in abnormally slow heart rates particularly in patients with sick sinus syndrome or second-or third-degree AV block six of patients for 0.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of diltiazem with beta-blockers or digitalis may result in additive effects on cardiac conduction. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in such patients. These reactions have been reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. As with any drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.</p>
<p>In subacute and chronic dog and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazem were associated with hepatic damage. Should a dermatologic reaction persist, the drug should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility A month study in rats and a month study in mice showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. There was also no mutagenic response in in vitro bacterial tests. No intrinsic effect on fertility was observed in rats. Pregnancy Category C Reproduction studies have been conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits. These doses, in some studies, have been reported to cause skeletal abnormalities.</p>
<p>There was an increased incidence of stillbirths at doses of 20 times the human dose or greater. There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, use CARDIZEM in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Diltiazem is excreted in human milk. One report suggests that concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of diltiazem did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p>
<p>In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The toxic dose in man is not known.</p>
<p>Diltiazem should be taken with a full glass of water either with or without food. Some reports indicate that grapefruit or grapefruit juice may interfere with the absorption of diltiazem. Some reports of side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea and tiredness.</p>
<p>It is possible that edema or swelling may occur from taking diltiazem. Anytime swelling is experienced, it is a good idea to consult with a physician to rule out any serious medical conditions. Are these all the same drug: They are the same drug, but they are not interchangeable. They have different formulations and different AB ratings. What this means is that a pharmacist may not substitute generic diltiazem if Cartia XT is prescribed.</p>
<p>Visit us here for more information: Does diltiazem affect the ability to feel low blood sugar? I take Lantus insulin for type 1 diabetes and sometimes don't feel the low sugar until I'm about to pass out.</p>
<p>Studies that were done have concluded that diltiazem does not have any significant effect on lowering blood sugar. I am 75 years old and I have been on diltiazem mg for one year. Should I be taking a calcium supplement? Diltiazem Cardizem and others is used to lower blood pressure and treat angina chest pain.</p>
<p>The drug belongs to the group of drugs known as calcium-channel blockers because of the way it works. Diltiazem prevents the flow of calcium in muscle tissue to keep the blood vessels from narrowing, making it easier for the heart to pump blood through the body. My feet have been swelling. Could that be from the diltiazem I take?</p>
<p>It should be taken with a full glass of water, either with or without food. Reports of side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea, and fatigue. It's possible that edema, or swelling, may occur from taking diltiazem. Any time you experience swelling, you should consult with your doctor to rule out any serious medical conditions. Kimberly Hotz, PharmD Q: I have high blood pressure, take diltiazem ER, and feel tired a lot.</p>
<p>Could it be from this? And it always seems that my pulse rate is low when I take my pressure with the machine.

Keep your drugs away from areas where they could get wet, such as bathrooms. Any time you experience swelling, you should consult with your doctor to rule out any serious medical conditions. Coadministration of diltiazem tablet rifampin or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, <i>cardizem tablet 30 mg</i>, and cardizem therapy considered. Diltiazem ER is the extended release formulation of diltiazem HCl and is designed to release the medication slowly into the body. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and Cmax during diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem hydrochloride has been shown to be a potent dilator of coronary arteries both epicardial and subendocardial. Diltiazem ER, in most situations, should be swallowed whole and not chewed or crushed. An <b>tablet</b> in the diltiazem dose may be warranted.
