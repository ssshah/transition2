            <h1>Most medications used during labor and delivery are not FDA Drug Therapy During Labor and Delivery (i.v. terbutaline in labor and delivery ritodrine or subcutaneous terbutaline).</h1>

		<p><p>In the mother, these include increased heart rate, transient hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and myocardial ischemia. Increased fetal heart rate and neonatal hypoglycemia may occur as a result of maternal administration.</p>
<p>General Terbutaline, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; in patients with hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines or who have convulsive disorders.</p>
<p>Significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions and exacerbations of bronchospasm have been reported after terbutaline administration.</p>
<p>Beta-adrenergic agonist medications may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Large doses of intravenous terbutaline have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p>
<p>The mutagenicity potential of terbutaline sulfate has not been determined. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, terbutaline should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. The structural formula is: Terbutaline sulfate USP is a white to gray-white crystalline powder.</p>
<p>It is odorless or has a faint odor of acetic acid. It is soluble in water and in 0. In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that Terbutaline exerts a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors. Controlled clinical studies in patients given Terbutaline subcutaneously have not revealed a preferential beta2-adrenergic effect. Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</p>
<p>Controlled clinical studies have shown that Terbutaline relieves bronchospasm in acute and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by significantly increasing pulmonary flow rates e. After subcutaneous administration of 0. The maximum effect usually occurs within 30 to 60 minutes, and clinically significant bronchodilator activity may continue for 1. The duration of clinically significant improvement is comparable to that observed with equimilligram doses of epinephrine.</p>
<p>Preclinical Studies in laboratory animals minipigs, rodents, and dogs have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death with histological evidence of myocardial necrosis when beta-agonists and methylxanthines are administered concurrently.</p>
<p>Terbutaline was prescribed as an oral medication in past years, but this form of the drug was discontinued due to dangerous side effects and safety concerns. Oral terbutaline should no longer be taken. Long term more than 72 hours of terbutaline is no longer recommended. Continual heart monitoring is standard practice. The drug is only supposed to be administered in hospital settings with medical staff available.</p>
<p>How does terbutaline work? Terbutaline is derived from a hormone called epinephrine , which is released when someone is under stress. Doctors give Terbutaline for preterm labor in certain urgent situations, but the risks of the Terbutaline drug are now believed to outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>It is used to help prevent asthma attacks and treat bronchitis and emphysema by relaxing bronchial tubes and easing asthma symptoms. It also is thought to relax the muscles of the uterus, which led manufacturers to promote Terbutaline for preterm labor. Terbutaline is not approved by the FDA for this purpose, therefore it is used "off-label" by physicians to control preterm labor. Generally, preterm labor's signs are contractions with cervical changes—i. The unapproved "off label" use of Terbutaline has recently been linked to an increase in birth injuries and maternal side effects.</p>
<p>Terbutaline side effects can be very dangerous, particularly to babies. Terbutaline adverse events have consequently led to a number of Terbutaline lawsuits. They may be born with serious health problems. Some health problems, like cerebral palsy, can last a lifetime. Other problems, such as learning disabilities, may appear later in childhood or even in adulthood.</p>
<p>Which preterm babies are at greatest risk of health problems? The risk of health problems is greatest for babies born before 34 weeks of pregnancy. But babies born between 34 weeks of pregnancy and 37 weeks of pregnancy also are at risk. What are risk factors for preterm birth? Factors that increase the risk of preterm birth include the following: Having a previous preterm birth Having a short cervix History of certain types of surgery on the uterus or cervix Certain pregnancy complications, such as multiple pregnancy and vaginal bleeding Lifestyle factors such as low prepregnancy weight, smoking during pregnancy, and substance abuse during pregnancy Can anything be done to prevent preterm birth if I am at high risk?</p>
<p>If you have had a prior preterm birth and you are planning another pregnancy, a preconception care checkup can help you get in the best possible health before you become pregnant.</p>
<p>When you become pregnant, be sure to start prenatal care early. You may be referred to a health care professional who has expertise in managing high-risk pregnancies.</p></p>
