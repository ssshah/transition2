		<p><p>I also found a blog post from that said there used to be a grapefruit warning on the drug info sheet prior to that but it was no longer mentioned in  To all, pomegranate enhances the effect of tamoxifen according to Pubmed http: It is unclear why some breast cancer cells resist TAM and how to make these cells respond.</p>
<p>Early evidence suggests Pomegranate fruit extracts PFEs exhibit an anticancer effect against some cancers. Collectively, the results showed for the first time that pomegranate combined with TAM may represent a novel and a powerful approach to enhance and sensitize TAM action. There's a substance called querecin sp? The only SSRI my MO said was acceptable for me to take while on tamoxifen was Effexor; she put me on it to lessen effect of possible hot flashes. So far so good: Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Your liver function may also need to be tested. Visit your doctor regularly. Before taking this medicine You should not use tamoxifen if you are allergic to it. You should not use tamoxifen to reduce your risk of breast cancer if you are also taking a blood thinner such as warfarin Coumadin, Jantoven. Do not take tamoxifen if you are pregnant.</p>
<p>Avoid becoming pregnant while you are using this medicine, and for at least 2 months after your treatment ends. Hormonal contraception such as birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings may not be effective enough to prevent pregnancy while taking tamoxifen.</p>
<p>You may also need to have a pregnancy test before you start taking tamoxifen, to make sure you are not pregnant. Talk with your doctor about your specific risks in taking this medicine. To make sure tamoxifen is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have: It is also produced in small amounts in the adrenal gland, placenta, liver, breasts, and fat cells.</p>
<p>Estrogen is a much-needed hormone, playing a pivotal role in the female reproductive system. It helps to stimulate the growth of egg follicles, contributes to the growth and overall health of the vagina, Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and breasts.</p>
<p>This important hormone also has major effects on bone health, working together with calcium, vitamin D, and other minerals and hormones to build bones. This is why osteoporosis tends to be a problem after menopause with declining estrogen levels. It limits the resorption breaking down of bone, thus preserving bone strength. Estrogen is also responsible for increasing the burning of body fat and for decreasing cholesterol. Tamoxifen works by blocking the actions of oestrogen, and therefore stopping or reducing tumour growth.</p>
<p>For women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer who are taking Tamoxifen, it is still unclear whether eating soy foods or taking soy supplements will block or enhance the actions of Tamoxifen. Results of scientific studies are contradictory.</p>
<p>A moderate consumption of soy foods, as part of an overall healthy eating plan, is unlikely to have any harmful effects. The aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole are approved to be given to postmenopausal women as initial therapy for metastatic or locally advanced hormone-sensitive breast cancer 8 , 9. These two drugs, as well as the aromatase inhibitor exemestane, are used to treat postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer whose disease has worsened after treatment with tamoxifen  Some women with advanced breast cancer are treated with a combination of hormone therapy and a targeted therapy.</p>
<p>Palbociclib inhibits two cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 that appear to promote the growth of hormone receptor—positive breast cancer cells. Palbociclib is also approved to be used in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of women with hormone receptor—positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose cancer has gotten worse after treatment with another hormone therapy. Neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer: The use of hormone therapy to treat breast cancer before surgery neoadjuvant therapy has been studied in clinical trials  The goal of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the size of a breast tumor to allow breast-conserving surgery.</p>
<p>Data from randomized controlled trials have shown that neoadjuvant hormone therapy—in particular, with aromatase inhibitors—can be effective in reducing the size of breast tumors in postmenopausal women. The results in premenopausal women are less clear because only a few small trials involving relatively few premenopausal women have been conducted thus far.</p>
<p>No hormone therapy has yet been approved by the FDA for the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Can hormone therapy be used to prevent breast cancer?</p>
<p>Long-term follow-up of another randomized trial, the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study I, found that 5 years of tamoxifen treatment reduces the incidence of breast cancer for at least 20 years  Take time for yourself everyday for exercise, laughter, relaxation and love, and benefit from a monthly massage.</p>
<p>Embrace every day and remind yourself everyday that you matter, that you deserve to be loved and cared for. Please understand that nothing in this post represents medical advice, and I encourage you to discuss this information with your integrative oncologist or naturopathic doctor. I have compiled this information solely for those seeking an alternative to Tamoxifen and cannot endorse either protocol.</p>

High dose soy or soy isoflavone supplements have not been tested for safety in women who have breast cancer or are taking Tamoxifen. Also, I wouldn't worry so much like individual foods. Therefore, while tamoxifen is anti-estrogenic to the breast, it also acts as an estrogen to the uterus and, to a lesser food, the heart, foods act like tamoxifen, blood vessels and bone. Better safe than like.
