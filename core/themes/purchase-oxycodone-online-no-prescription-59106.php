		<p><p>Though this can be stimulated through a vibrator the deep vibrations are able to reach underneath , it is less sensitive than the tip, which can be stimulated through foreplay and intercourse. Rub your thumbs in little circles around the clit while licking the head with a pointed tongue.</p>
<p>In the missionary position, while you thrust inside the woman, she can do a downward roll of the pelvis. This will provide direct friction to the clit. U-Spot This is a small area of sensitive erectile tissue located just above and on both sides of the urethral opening. In other words, just above the vaginal opening. This can be stimulated by gently caressing it with the finger, tongue, or tip of the penis.</p>
<p>Lick the inner part of the vaginal lips, right above the clit. The inner part of her lips get licked, right above clit. Slip well lubricated fingers in and gently move them horizontally and vertically, or in circles. These programs are designed to aid in detecting prescription-drug diversion while also preventing it by increasing the risk of identifying and apprehending offenders. PMPs document all retail sales of certain prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Police can analyze this data to identify unusual sales volumes by retailer, healthcare provider, and drug type. You may contact your state data collection entities to gain access to the data, which can illustrate the types of prescription drugs that are dispensed, the degree to which certain medical prescribers appear to be overprescribing, and other statewide patterns of potential misuse and diversion.</p>
<p>Local Data Collection The above sources are limited to data at the state or metropolitan area level, but they may not tell the local story. Police agencies that have tackled the problem of prescription fraud and misuse typically create their own data collection tools in order to capture the true local context and underlying causes of the problem.</p>
<p>The Reno Nevada Police Department, for example, conducted surveys of area pharmacists and doctors and also reviewed and revised the way the department coded reported incidents of prescription fraud and misuse to enable the agency to isolate those cases from other drug-related crimes. You should take measures of your problem before you implement responses, to determine how serious the problem is, and after you implement them, to determine whether they have been effective.</p>
<p>All measures should be taken in both the target area and the surrounding area. The following are potentially useful measures of the effectiveness of responses to prescription fraud and misuse. Process measures show the extent to which responses were properly implemented.</p>
<p>Outcome measures show the extent to which the responses reduced the level or severity of the problem. Process Measures Changes in arrest patterns for drug possession and sales in your and neighboring jurisdictions Changes in types of prescription fraud and misuse e.</p>
<p>For example, if you launch a public education campaign for pharmacists and doctors, you may find that the incidence of prescription fraud - as measured by crimes reported and calls for police service - increases, which is desirable in the short term, but which should subsequently decline as prevention measures take effect.</p>
<p>Responses to the Problem of Prescription Drug Fraud and Misuse Your analysis of your local prescription fraud and misuse problem should give you a better understanding of the factors contributing to it. Once you have analyzed your local problem and established a baseline for measuring effectiveness, you should consider possible responses to address the problem. The following response strategies provide a foundation of ideas for addressing your particular prescription fraud and misuse problem.</p>
<p>These strategies are drawn from a variety of research studies and police experiences. Several of these strategies may apply to your community's problem. It is critical that you tailor responses to local and state circumstances, and that you can justify each response based on reliable analysis. In most cases, an effective strategy will involve implementing several different responses.</p>
<p>Law enforcement responses alone are seldom effective in reducing or solving the problem. Do not limit yourself to considering what police can do: In some cases the responsibility of responding may need to be shifted toward those who have the capacity to implement more effective responses. For more detailed information on shifting and sharing responsibility, see Response Guide No. For further information on managing the implementation of response strategies, see Problem-Solving Tools Guide No.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is limited information about the effectiveness of many of the strategies presented below because few of the strategies have been evaluated. The government has provided some funding to police to reduce prescription fraud, but to date there have been no national evaluations of task force or state and local police efforts to combat this problem.</p>
<p>Although the government has funded state prescription monitoring programs and general awareness campaigns, with the exception of Utah's educational campaign as part of their Prescription Pain Medication Program, only prescription monitoring programs have been empirically evaluated. Because the prescription fraud and misuse problem crosses several disciplines, addressing it must be a coordinated effort at all stages.</p>
<p>The stakeholders described in the previous section are among the most critical in controlling prescription fraud and misuse. Sharing information among agencies about prescription drug use implicates healthcare privacy, so stakeholders should be aware of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and comparable state laws. Many states and local jurisdictions have specialized personnel, units, or task forces to implement prescription fraud prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Although there has been an increase in knowledge among specialized groups, most police officers still need specialized training on: You should also educate prescribers about the various prescription fraud tactics and the extent of your local problem. Healthcare providers should register with their prescription drug monitoring program PMP and consult it as part of their practice; prescribe medication only when necessary and only in amounts necessary; give instructions on returning leftover medications; identify misuse and addiction; and provide resources to help patients handle addiction problems.</p>
<p>They also should report all thefts of prescription pads to police and local pharmacies. Moreover, they should advise patients of the dangers of procuring prescription medications through the Internet, which can lead to misuse and addiction. In an informational brochure for pharmacists, the DEA recommends using common sense, sound professional practice, and proper dispensing procedures and controls see text box. Others have also created guidelines to help pharmacists recognize misuse and fraud.</p>
<p>Given the increasing prevalence of youth abusing prescription drugs and the fact that many youth obtain drugs through friends and family members, parents also need to secure their legally prescribed drugs. Teachers can also convey these messages, as can police, who can visit the schools and underscore the fact that prescription drug misuse is illegal and dangerous. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration created an informational brochure for healthcare practitioners that gives specific guidance and outlines the responsibilities for preventing prescription drug abuse and diversion.</p>
<p>Although some aspects are unique to Canadian laws, there is a variety of material applicable to any health professional. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration produced a brochure designed to educate students about the dangers of prescription drug misuse. A number of local efforts have also produced videos to educate youth about the harms and consequences of prescription drug misuse: States are responsible for enacting laws that govern the prescribing and dispensing of prescription drugs, licensing drug prescribers, investigating complaints, and imposing sanctions for violations of state medical practice laws.</p>
<p>States also regulate pharmacy practice and license pharmacists and pharmacies, ensure compliance with state and federal laws, and require the maintenance of prescription records.</p>
<p>A number of local, state, and federal efforts to discuss the problem of prescription fraud and misuse, make recommendations, and create plans have emerged over the last decade. In , the Executive Office of the President issued a Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan to reduce prescription drug misuse through education, monitoring, proper disposal, and enforcement.</p>
<p>Many of these plans and recommendations have excellent ideas, but very little documentation exists on their implementation and effectiveness. Fraudulent Prescription Prevention Techniques 64 Know the prescriber and his or her signature. Know the patient or get a profile if you do not. Check the date on the prescription.</p>
<p>Ensure it has been presented within a reasonable time. Telephone the prescriber for verification or clarification if you have any questions. The patient should give a plausible reason for any discrepancy before you dispense the drug.</p>
<p>If you are in doubt, request proper identification; doing so increases an offender's risk of getting caught. If you believe a prescription is forged or altered, do not dispense it - call the local police. If you believe that you have discovered a pattern of prescription misuses, contact the state pharmacy board or the DEA.</p>
<p>Many police agencies, task forces, and pharmacy associations deem it effective to share information on prescription fraud scams and offenders through bulletins and mass communication.</p>
<p>If prospective scam targets e. Each month, the Tarrant County Medical Society also distributes a health-scam report. The Texas Pharmacy Association has set up an online system for reporting fraud or stolen prescription pads. The state of Colorado and Johnson County, Kansas, use a PharmAlert hotline for notification, while Abington, Pennsylvania, police handed out fliers describing the scam and including a photo of the suspect or fraudulent prescription.</p>
<p>After implementing this strategy in , Abington saw arrests of prescription fraud offenders increase from one per year to one to two per month.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, healthcare professionals and pharmacists have not had extensive training on prescription misuse and fraud so they may not be aware of the symptoms, or how they may be inadvertently contributing to the problem. Improving pharmacists' screening of prescriptions and patients. Pharmacists are the last line of defense against prescription fraud. They should always check the patient's identification, verify the doctor's information when it is not familiar, and use their experience and knowledge to judge when a patient's behavior is suspicious or a prescription may be fraudulent.</p>
<p>Although these usually have not been police-led efforts, police can play a role in making the public aware that misuse and addiction are the underlying causes of much prescription fraud.</p>
<p>Although most offenders commit prescription fraud to get drugs for personal use due to addiction , and most crime-prevention efforts have targeted this underlying cause, this does not lessen the importance of dealing with offenders who commit fraud strictly for financial gain. In , the Community Antidrug Coalitions of America developed and distributed prescription drug misuse messages, materials, and methods to better educate the public, education departments, healthcare providers, and community-based organizations.</p>
<p>More recently, there were two statewide efforts: In addition, such campaigns can help enlist offenders' friends and relatives to provide informal guardianship by better detecting suspicious activity and providing help before the problem escalates. Although a few of the larger pharmaceutical companies have recently partnered with police to curtail prescription fraud and misuse, it is most important that they continue to educate people about taking drugs safely under a doctor's care.</p>
<p>If a nonopioid combination analgesic provides comparable pain relief to that obtained by oral opioids commonly used in the ED, it is possible that physicians may be more likely to discharge patients and prescribe the same nonopioid combination analgesics. In addition, patients might be more accepting of that analgesic so long as it provides ample pain relief when used in the ED. This change in prescribing habit could potentially help mitigate the ongoing opioid epidemic by reducing the number of people initially exposed to opioids and the subsequent risk of addiction, as shown in a recent study 13 that found long-term opioid use was significantly higher among patients treated by high-intensity ED opioid prescribers than among patients treated by low-intensity ED opioid prescribers.</p>
<p>Limitations This study has several limitations. First, the follow-up time was limited to 2 hours. Although a more prolonged follow-up would have provided additional information, the goal was to determine if a single dose of an analgesic would provide superior pain relief for patients while in the ED.</p>
<p>In addition, the enrolled patient population included those generally seen in a fast-track setting, in which patients are discharged quickly with minimal or no testing. Whether the duration of analgesia differs among the analgesics is unknown, although the half-lives are similar and range from approximately 3 hours to 4 hours.</p>
<p>Second, the oral opioids used in this study may be dispensed as 1 or 2 tablets at a time. We chose to administer the equivalent of 1 tablet. There are no nationally representative data sets that allow estimation of usual analgesic dose in the ED setting.</p>
<p>For example, the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey 2 has medication and route information but not dose information. The dosage used in this study represents common practice among physicians from a variety of training programs and institutions. The dose of opioid chosen also reflects prior studies, 3 - 5 which have shown effective pain relief at the identical dosages used in the current study.</p>
<p>In addition, there was concern that many physicians would not refer patients for enrollment if it meant administering higher doses of opioids because most patients were expected to be discharged quickly and the rescue analgesic was predefined to be 5 mg of oxycodone.</p>
<p>However, additional analyses imputing NRS pain score for patients who received rescue analgesics also showed no clinically important or statistically significant difference. Fourth, adverse effect information was not collected. Such information could influence the choice of analgesic prescribed, especially if one group had significantly more adverse effects than another group. Significant adverse effects were not expected to occur during the 2-hour follow-up of this study. However, a similar ED-based study lasting 90 minutes had an incidence of adverse events of 1.</p>
<p>In that study, the amount of oxycodone and codeine administered was double the dose used in the current study and thus is not directly comparable. A combination product of ibuprofen and acetaminophen paracetamol in a single tablet is available for patients in Australia and New Zealand, though in smaller dosages than were used in this study. Conclusions For patients presenting to the ED with acute extremity pain, there were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours among single-dose treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen or with 3 different opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics.</p>
