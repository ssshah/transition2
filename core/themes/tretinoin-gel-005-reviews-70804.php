		<p><p>This is very important because it will make your skin more susceptible to photo aging. Originally developed as an acne cream, it was discovered that Tretinoin had various other benefits.</p>
<p>Not only did it smooth out acne inflated skin, but it also correct sun damaged areas, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation , oiliness and skin radiance. Tretinoin miraculously extrudes plugged material from the skin follicles. By exfoliating the dirt and grime that builds up on facial skin, Tretinoin helps to form new collagen and even new blood vessels. Thus, enhancing the appearance of the skin. It is to be used once a day, preferably at night.</p>
<p>The face must be cleansed and completely dry in order for Tretinoin to work properly. Less is more with Tretinoin products. Therefore, large quantities are not recommended. Continued use is key, as it takes some time to take effect. It is common to experience some redness or flaking of the skin. This is all part of the exfoliating magic taking place! Rubbing a damp cloth on flaking areas will help to gently remove the dead skin.</p>
<p>How Effective are Tretinoin Creams? Proven to effectively treat sun damaged skin, Tretinoin helps to reduce rough spots and discoloration of the pigment. Improvements are usually noted within three or four weeks of consistent use. Tretinoin users have reported that brown spots normally take about six to eight weeks and fine wrinkles start to diminish after three to six months of use. The process may seem slow, but the results are promising.</p>
<p>Key Points to Remember Sunscreen- When starting a Tretinoin regime, be sure to apply a sunscreen during the day. Tretinoin increases sun sensitivity. Lack of sun protection can lead to easily burned skin. Clean and dry skin- Clean, dry skin is mandatory for the application of Tretinoin.</p>
<p>Many chemicals can interfere with effectiveness of the cream. Ensure a proper cleaning and wait for your face to fully dry before application. Tretinoin must fully absorb into your skin. Having water on the surface of your face will prevent it from settling properly. The extra benefits of clearing up my face is wonderful.</p>
<p>The first couple of weeks my skin was really peeling. Now my skin seems to have adjusted. I am using a very small amount like the size of a pea. My skin burns and itches so baddd! I have a wedding in 7 months. No doctor can help me, seriously this is a joke. Drs are nothing but scams. Now a junior in college, I still had bad breakouts from my period and acne scars from over the years. I decided to visit a dermatologist and she recommended Retin-A. I use Cetaphil cleanser every day in the morning and night then tone my face with witch hazel super good on the skin and does not burn and finish off with Shea Moisture problem skin moisturizer.</p>
<p>It is okay to skip a couple days in between. Pat a gentle moisturizer on top if skin feels dry. Use a high-protection sunscreen during the day. Some people have reported a face full of pimples from this initial breakout. Use Retino-A only at night. Never skip sunscreen during the day even if you use Retino-A only at night. Do not use any exfoliating cleansers, toners, moisturizers, whitening treatments, scrubs or peels. Retino-A makes skin extremely sensitive to basically everything, so using abrasive or exfoliating stuff alongside is skin suicide.</p>
<p>Keep watching for signs of hypo pigmentation lighter coloured skin patches. Stop use until hypo pigmentation fades. If you notice some swelling of the skin, it means you are either using too much Retino-A or too often.</p>
<p>Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of Tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain. The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known.</p>
<p>Topical Tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0. Oral Tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of Tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, edematous, blistered, or crusted.</p>
<p>If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the medication should be adjusted to a level the patient can tolerate. This property became one of the main reasons for its use in cosmetic practice as a means of chemical peels. The penetration depth is determined by the acid concentration of the solution, and the exposure time.</p>
<p>Through the use of glycolic acid produces deletion keratinized cell layers from the skin surface and the cleaning of the sebaceous glands.</p>
<p>As a result, normal process of secretion and outflow of sebum, the skin becomes susceptible to the penetration of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Hydroxyacetic acid stimulates the synthesis of collagen and gialouranovoy acid normalizes metabolism and skin microcirculation. This allows you to effectively deal with hyperkeratosis manifestations of acne, seborrhea, cellulite, ichthyoids, photo aging, including increased dryness and sagging skin.</p>
