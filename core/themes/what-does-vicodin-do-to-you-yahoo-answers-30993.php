		<p><p>Vicodin comes in 3 strengths: Those addicted look to "score" 10 mg Vicodin which carry several street nicknames. To do this, those addicted Dr. Shop, write fake prescriptions, order drugs online illegally, sell everything they own to buy them on the street, and even go so far as to perform sexual favors to obtain the drug. An even larger danger is the fact that most people are not aware that Vicodin contains tylenol that when taken in large quantity cause liver damage leading to liver failure and death.</p>
<p>Large doses also cause respiratory failure leading to death. Most recently, long term abuse of Vicodin has been linked to deafness. Symptoms of withdrawal include: To make this more real for you, a few years back the great quarterback of the Greenbay Packers, Bret Favre, was sidelined when he was ordered to rehab for Vicodin abuse and addiction.</p>
<p>It is easy to abuse Vicodin with production approaching 20 tons annually. The US, Congress recently heard statistics regarding opiod deaths as follows: Since that time this number has increased significantly. Adults are no less susceptible to abuse and addiction then are America's youth. If you, or someone you know are taking Vicodin recreationally, PLEASE PLEASE, speak to your physician, a friend, counselor, teacher, pastor, or someone that can help you seek the help you need and deserve before you suffer any of the above serious consequences, death, or hurt someone else while under the influence.</p>
<p>One could argue whether or not Heroin is technically opium or not: Chemical make up Heroin sees its origin in the opium poppy. It is semi-synthetic, meaning that something naturally occurring has been taken and processed into something stronger.</p>
<p>Now in plain english what this means is your pain is blocked, and in replacement of this, the "reward" portion of your brain actually make you feel good. Kind of like acupuncture while getting a neck massage.</p>
<p>Often the precursor to nausea is severe iching of the skin. Today zofran is used more, which has a higher degree of targeting the portion of the brain sensitive to the histamines which cause nausea. Not all opioids produce the same histamine levels, such as fentanyl which is known to produce less histamine, but also less euphoria while providing superior pain relief.</p>
<p>Thus more operations in the recovery phase exhibit fewer qualm incidents. However, for those who do exhibit nausea, OTC medications like Meclizine can help tremendously. Once physical addiction begins, and noradrenaline is no longer produced, the body will exhibit withdrawal symptoms such as cold sweats, tears, diahrea, vomiting, and a massive overall sense of dysphoria, which is the opposite of euphoria.</p>
<p>This can best be imagined as if the body is rebounding from pain to the point where a person can hardly get out of bed, or lives in the bathroom floor for a day of agony per hour of active dose duration. For example hydrocodone with a 2. The amount of a gony depends on the dose size. Generally the rule of thumb is for every 10mg oraitorl monl morphine daily would result in a pain level of out of 10, where a dose of 60mg per dose will cause a level of agony, thuse the need for carefuful tapering is needed.</p></p>
