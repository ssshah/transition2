		<p><p>Aplastic anemia is characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia together with a bone marrow examination that shows decreases in the precursor cells for red blood cells , white blood cells, and platelets. Patients may present with signs or symptoms suggestive of infection , in association with low white blood cell and platelet counts.</p>
<p>Prompt treatment, which may include the use of drugs to stimulate the bone marrow , can minimize the mortality associated with aplastic anemia.</p>
<p>Monitoring for Hematologic Adverse Reactions: Starting just before initiating treatment and continuing through the third month of therapy, patients receiving TICLID ticlopidine hcl must be monitored every 2 weeks. Because of discontinue ticlopidine during this 3-month period should continue to be monitored for 2 weeks after discontinuation. Clinically, fever might suggest neutropenia, TTP, or aplastic anemia; TTP might also be suggested by weakness, pallor, petechiae or purpura , dark urine due to blood, bile pigments, or hemoglobin or jaundice , or neurological changes.</p>
<p>Patients should be told to discontinue TICLID ticlopidine hcl and to contact the physician immediately upon the occurrence of any of these findings. Ticlopidine is occasionally associated with thrombocytopenia unrelated to TTP or aplastic anemia.</p>
<p>Any acute , unexplained reduction in hemoglobin or platelet count should prompt further investigation for a diagnosis of TTP, and the appearance of schistocytes fragmented RBCs on the smear should be treated as presumptive evidence of TTP. A simultaneous decrease in platelet count and WBC count should prompt further investigation for a diagnosis of aplastic anemia.</p>
<p>Rare cases of agranulocytosis , pancytopenia , or leukemia have been reported in postmarketing experience, some of which have been fatal. All forms of hematological adverse reactions are potentially fatal. The ratios of the lipoprotein subfractions are unchanged. The tolerance and long-term safety of coadministration of TICLID ticlopidine hcl with heparin , oral anticoagulants or fibrinolytic agents have not been established. In trials for cardiac stenting, patients received heparin and TICLID ticlopidine hcl concomitantly for approximately 12 hours.</p>
<p>TICLID ticlopidine hcl should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery or pathological conditions. If it is desired to eliminate the antiplatelet effects of TICLID ticlopidine hcl prior to elective surgery, the drug should be discontinued 10 to 14 days prior to surgery. Several controlled clinical studies have found increased surgical blood loss in patients undergoing surgery during treatment with ticlopidine.</p>
<p>Several hundred patients underwent surgery during the trials, and no excessive surgical bleeding was reported. Prolonged bleeding time is normalized within 2 hours after administration of 20 mg methylprednisolone IV. The drug should be used with caution in patients who have lesions with a propensity to bleed such as ulcers.</p>
<p>Use in Hepatically Impaired Patients: Since ticlopidine is metabolized by the liver, dosing of TICLID ticlopidine hcl or other drugs metabolized in the liver may require adjustment upon starting or stopping concomitant therapy. Use in Renally Impaired Patients: Moderate Platelet Inhibitors inhibit platelet aggregation and should be used cautiously in patients with thrombocytopenia, as mycophenolate can also cause thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p>Moderate Due to the thrombocytopenic effects of nelarabine, an additive risk of bleeding may be seen in patients receiving concomitant platelet inhibitors. The manufacturer of clopidogrel advises that caution be used when used in combination with NSAIDs as an increase in occult GI blood loss occurred when clopidogrel was used concomitantly with naproxen Obinutuzumab: Moderate Fatal hemorrhagic events have been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab; all events occured during cycle 1.</p>
<p>Monitor all patients for thrombocytopenia and bleeding, and consider withholding concomitant medications which may increase bleeding risk i. Moderate Due to the risk of bleeding and coagulopathy during pegaspargase therapy, patients should receive other agents that may increase the risk of bleeding e. Moderate A potential additive risk for bleeding exists if platelet inhibitors are given in combination with other agents that affect hemostasis such as pentoxifylline.</p>
<p>Moderate Concurrent use of topiramate and drugs that affect platelet function such as aspirin, ASA and other salicylates or platelet inhibitors may increase the risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, bleeding was more frequently reported in patients receiving topiramate 4. In those with severe bleeding events, patients were often taking drugs that cause thrombocytopenia or affect platelet function or coagulation. Minor Agents, such as platelet inhibitors, that decrease clotting could decrease the efficacy of photosensitizing agents used in photodynamic therapy. Moderate Prasterone is contraindicated for use in patients with active deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or history of these conditions.</p>
<p>Prasterone is also contraindicated in patients with active arterial thromboembolic disease for example, stroke and myocardial infarction , or a history of these conditions. Thus, patients receiving anticoagulation due to a history of these conditions are not candidates for prasterone treatment.</p>
<p>DHEA is converted to androgens and estrogens within the human body and thus may affect hemostasis via androgenic or estrogenic effects. Androgens, such as testosterone, increase the synthesis of several anticoagulant and fibrinolytic proteins. Because of the potential effects on coagulation, patients receiving prasterone or DHEA concurrently with preventative anticoagulants e. Major Avoid concurrent administration of platelet inhibitors such as clopidogrel with rivaroxaban unless the benefit outweighs the risk of increased bleeding.</p>
<p>An increase in bleeding time to 45 minutes was observed in two drug interaction studies where clopidogrel mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily maintenance dose and rivaroxaban 15 mg single dose were coadministered in healthy subjects. The change in bleeding time was approximately twice the maximum increase seen with either drug alone.</p>
<p>No change in the pharmacokinetic parameters of either drug were noted. Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid: Moderate Increased bruising or bleeding at the injection site may occur when using hyaluronate sodium with platelet inhibitors especially if used within the 3 weeks prior to the procedure.</p>
<p>Moderate Use caution when administering velpatasvir with ticlopidine. Taking these drugs together may increase velpatasvir plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in adverse events. Moderate Due to the thrombocytopenic effects of sorafenib, an additive risk of bleeding may be seen in patients receiving concomitant platelet inhibitors.</p>
<p>Major Sulfinpyrazone, when used as a uricosuric agent should be avoided when possible with concurrent platelet inhibitors due to potential for additive antiplatelet effects and increased bleeding risk. Tamoxifen is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and to a smaller extent by CYP2C19, to other potent, active metabolites including endoxifen, which have up to 33 times more affinity for the estrogen receptor than tamoxifen. Theoretically, concomitant use of ticlopidine and tamoxifen may result in decreased concentrations of the active metabolites of tamoxifen; the clinical significance of this interaction is not known.</p>
<p>Moderate Due to the risk for terbinafine related adverse effects, caution is advised when coadministering ticlopidine. Although this interaction has not been studied by the manufacturer, and published literature suggests the potential for interactions to be low, taking these drugs together may increase the systemic exposure of terbinafine. Predictions about the interaction can be made based on the metabolic pathways of both drugs.</p>
<p>Terbinafine is metabolized by at least 7 CYP isoenyzmes, with major contributions coming from CYP2C19; ticlopidine is an inhibitor of this enzyme. Monitor patients for adverse reactions if these drugs are coadministered. Major Aminophylline clearance may be significantly reduced when ticlopidine is administered concomitantly. Aminophylline serum concentrations should be monitored when ticlopidine is added or withdrawn. Major Coadministration of theophylline and ticlopidine can result in increased theophylline exposure and risk for toxicity.</p>
<p>Theophylline half-life increased from 8. Monitor serum theophylline concentrations and signs of theophylline toxicity and efficiacy when ticlopidine is added to or withdrawn from a medication regimen containing theophylline.</p>
<p>Major Concomitant administration of platelet inhibitors and thrombolytic agents could theoretically result in an increased risk of bleeding due to additive pharmacodynamic effects, and combinations of these agents should be approached with caution.</p>
<p>Moderate Caution should be used when administering tipranavir to patients receiving platelet inhibitors. In clinical trials, there have been reports of intracranial bleeding, including fatalities, in HIV infected patients receiving tipranavir as part of combination antiretroviral therapy. If possible, avoid the concurrent use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as ticlopidine, as concurrent use could lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations.</p>
<p>If concurrent use cannot be avoided, initiate tizanidine therapy with the 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg increments daily based on patient response to therapy. Discontinue tizanidine if hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur. Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist about all the products you use including prescription drugs , nonprescription drugs, and herbal products.</p>
<p>Your doctor may instruct you to stop ticlopidine for 10 to 14 days before surgery. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Ask your doctor before taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug NSAID for pain, arthritis, fever, or swelling. This includes aspirin, ibuprofen Advil, Motrin , naproxen Aleve , and others. Taking ticlopidine with certain other drugs can increase your risk of bleeding.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using, especially: Tell your doctor about all other medications you use, especially: This list is not complete. Other drugs may interact with ticlopidine, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.</p>
<p>The incidence of the hematologic adverse reactions declines thereafter. Only a few cases of neutropenia, TTP, or aplastic anemia have arisen after more than 3 months of therapy. Hematological adverse reactions cannot be reliably predicted by any identified demographic or clinical characteristics. During the first 3 months of treatment, patients receiving this drug must, therefore, be hematologically and clinically monitored for evidence of neutropenia or TTP.</p></p>
