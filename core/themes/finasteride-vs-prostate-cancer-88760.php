            <h1>Finasteride vs prostate cancer</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>But because this was a double-blind study, the patients taking finasteride did not know that their PSA levels were artificially low. Therefore, fewer patients taking the drug who were told to have a biopsy followed that advice. Were there fewer cancers in these patients because finasteride actually prevents cancer or because fewer men got a biopsy in the first place? In this study, 15 percent fewer men on finasteride underwent a biopsy because they were lulled into a false sense of security by their low PSA level.</p>
<p>Thus, the major effect of this drug was to keep patients from knowing that they even needed a biopsy. Of the men in the study who actually had a biopsy, the frequency of positive biopsies for cancer was statistically the same in patients in both test groups. Walsh is very concerned about the increase in high-grade disease and the possibility that this presents an unacceptable risk for a form of treatment that has little or no value.</p>
<p>Walsh noted that when patients on finasteride are diagnosed with prostate cancer, they are more likely to have dangerous, high-grade disease. The real danger is that many patients will be lulled into a false sense of security. Risky Business for Two Patients Dr. Walsh has seen this risk in action in multiple patients. One man had a PSA of 3.</p>
<p>Both of them had high-grade prostate cancer classified as Gleason 8 disease that had spread outside the prostate. One of them had a positive surgical margin. If surgical margins the edges of the removed tumor are positive, they show cancer cells or indicate that the cancer is just a short distance from the edge of the specimen.</p>
<p>Avoid finasteride to save money and reduce risk of high-grade disease Dr. Walsh has been greatly troubled by the pressure for patients and general physicians to use finasteride. His conclusions about this drug include: It has no primary effect in reducing the number of men who will have a positive biopsy. This hormone influences the size of the prostate and can fuel the growth of prostate tumors. Finasteride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and is also approved to treat male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>It has not been approved for preventing prostate cancer. The PCPT was stopped in February , 15 months earlier than planned, when a scheduled data analysis showed a 25 percent reduction in prostate cancer risk among participants taking finasteride compared with those taking a placebo and a 38 percent reduction in risk of low-grade prostate cancers.</p>
<p>That original analysis also showed a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of high-grade prostate cancer—cancers with a Gleason score of 7 to 10, which are considered more likely to be aggressive and life threatening—in the men taking finasteride.</p>
<p>The original analysis focused on the men who had undergone a biopsy or other diagnostic procedure during the trial approximately half of the study population , whereas the updated analysis included the entire study population. Subsequent analyses of the PCPT data suggested that the observed increase in high-grade prostate cancers in men taking finasteride was due, at least in part, to improved detection.</p>
<p>For example, finasteride shrinks the volume of the prostate, potentially making high-grade cancers easier to detect on biopsy.</p>
<p>However, concerns that finasteride might cause a true increase in the risk of high-grade prostate cancer—and death—have remained, so the PCPT investigators analyzed long-term follow-up data for trial participants to look for mortality differences between finasteride-treated men and placebo-treated men.</p>
<p>The Study Nearly 19, men age 55 and older who were in good health and showed no evidence of prostate cancer were enrolled in the PCPT. The men were randomly assigned to take 5 mg of finasteride or a placebo daily for 7 years.</p>
<p>Participants in the trial had their health status monitored at regular intervals, including two tests conducted annually to look for signs of prostate cancer:</p></p>
		
		<h2>Dutasteride vs. Finasteride Side Effects, Uses, Dosage</h2>
		<p>Both drugs are available in generic forms. One man had a PSA of 3. Dutasteride Avodart is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound that is a selective <i>prostate</i> of both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of prostate 5 alpha-reductase used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH in men with an enlarged prostate, finasteride vs prostate cancer. Many patients respond to finasteride within several weeks, but it can take up to 6 months for patients to experience the full effects of the drug. However, <b>finasteride vs prostate cancer</b>, concerns that finasteride might cause a true increase in the risk of high-grade prostate cancer—and death—have remained, so the PCPT investigators analyzed long-term follow-up data for trial participants to look for mortality differences between finasteride-treated men and finasteride men. Finasteride blocks the activity of 5-alpha reductase, an enzyme that helps control the activity of the hormone testosterone. Finasteride is prescribed for the treatment of enlarged prostate benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH under the brand name "Proscar. If surgical margins the edges of the removed cancer are positive, <i>finasteride vs prostate cancer</i>, they <b>cancer</b> cancer cells or indicate that the cancer is just a short distance from the edge of the specimen. Background Launched in Januarythe PCPT was a large randomized clinical trial designed to test finasteride the drug finasteride could help prevent prostate cancer in men age 55 and older. While finasteride can result in reductions in the size of the prostate gland in virtually all patients who take it, only half will have improvement in the symptoms of BPH.</p><br clear="left" />
		
		<h2>18-Year Study Finds Drug Cut Prostate Cancer Risk</h2>

Both drugs are available in generic forms. It has no primary effect in reducing the number of men who will have a positive biopsy. The concern over the high-grade cancer <i>prostates</i> led officials back then to decline recommending finasteride as a prostate cancer prevention tool. The only thing that finasteride can do is prevent you from prostate that you may have lethal cancer until it may be too late to cure. When checking back <b>finasteride</b> the men involved in the earlier trial, researchers behind the new study found that the drug actually worked better than earlier reported in reducing prostate cancer risk. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, <i>finasteride vs prostate cancer</i>. Both drugs are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH in men with an enlarged prostate, <b>finasteride vs prostate cancer</b>. Patients will believe that it prevents cancer, will be pleased that their PSA levels <i>cancer</i> and will not understand the potential danger of developing undiagnosed, high-grade disease. His conclusions about this drug include: Walsh has been greatly troubled by the cancer for patients and general physicians to use finasteride.</p><br clear="left" />
		
		<h2>Finasteride: Are the Risks Worth it?</h2>
		<p>Both dutasteride and finasteride help lower the amount of a specific hormone, <b>finasteride vs prostate cancer</b>, dihydrotestosterone DHTthat causes growth of the prostate gland. Dutasteride may also cause ejaculation disorder, <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/themes/citalopram-with-xanax-together-48692.php">citalopram with xanax together</a> enlargement, and prostate tenderness, finasteride vs prostate cancer. This hormone influences the size of the prostate and can fuel the growth of prostate tumors. When checking back with the men involved in the earlier trial, prostates behind the new study found that the drug actually worked better than earlier reported in reducing prostate cancer risk. Dutasteride is sometimes given with tamsulosin Flomaxwhich is used to treat signs and symptoms of enlarged prostate. It's causing more prostate cancer to be diagnosed. Results In the updated analysis, men <b>cancer</b> finasteride had a 30 percent cancer in the relative risk of developing prostate <i>finasteride</i> compared with men who took a placebo: Otis Brawley, chief cancer officer for the American Cancer Society. There was no difference between the finasteride and placebo groups regarding overall long-term survival or survival following a prostate cancer diagnosis, <i>finasteride vs prostate cancer</i>. According finasteride Patrick C. How do they work? Both drugs are available in generic forms.
