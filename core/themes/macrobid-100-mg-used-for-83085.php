		<p><p>This is usually a harmless, temporary effect and will disappear when the medication is stopped. However, dark brown urine can also be a sign of rare side effects liver problems or anemia.</p>
<p>Therefore, seek immediate medical attention if you notice dark urine along with any of the following symptoms: Tell your doctor right away if any of these rare but very serious side effects occur: Seek immediate medical attention if you develop the following rare but very serious side effects: This medication may rarely cause very serious possibly fatal lung problems.</p>
<p>Optic neuritis has been reported rarely in postmarketing experience with nitrofurantoin formulations. Cases of hemolytic anemia of the primaquine-sensitivity type have been induced by nitrofurantoin. Hemolysis appears to be linked to a glucosephosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in the red blood cells of the affected patients. This deficiency is found in 10 percent of Blacks and a small percentage of ethnic groups of Mediterranean and Near-Eastern origin.</p>
<p>Hemolysis is an indication for discontinuing Macrobid; hemolysis ceases when the drug is withdrawn. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including nitrofurantoin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. Hypertoxin producing strains of C.</p>
<p>CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. Precautions Information for Patients Patients should be advised to take Macrobid with food ideally breakfast and dinner to further enhance tolerance and improve drug absorption.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to complete the full course of therapy; however, they should be advised to contact their physician if any unusual symptoms occur during therapy.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised not to use antacid preparations containing magnesium trisilicate while taking Macrobid. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Macrobid should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections e. When Macrobid is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may 1 decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and 2 increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Macrobid or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools with or without stomach cramps and fever even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic.</p>
<p>If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. General Prescribing Macrobid in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Drug Interactions Antacids containing magnesium trisilicate, when administered concomitantly with nitrofurantoin, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption.</p>
<p>The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of nitrofurantoin onto the surface of magnesium trisilicate. Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. The resulting increase in nitrofurantoin serum levels may increase toxicity, and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial.</p>
<p>Macrobid side effects Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction to Macrobid: Call your doctor at once if you have: Serious side effects may be more likely in older adults and those who are ill or debilitated. Common Macrobid side effects may include: This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.</p>
<p>Macrobid dosing information Usual Adult Dose for Cystitis: Greater than 12 years: Other drugs may interact with nitrofurantoin, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Tell each of your health care providers about all medicines you use now and any medicine you start or stop using.</p>
<p>Further information Remember, keep this and all other medicines out of the reach of children, never share your medicines with others, and use Macrobid only for the indication prescribed. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antimicrobial treatment.</p>
<p>Peripheral neuropathy , which may become severe or irreversible, has occurred. Fatalities have been reported. Conditions such as renal impairment creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine , anemia , diabetes mellitus , electrolyte imbalance, vitamin B deficiency, and debilitating diseases may increase the possibility of peripheral neuropathy. Asthenia , vertigo , and nystagmus also have been reported with the use of nitrofurantoin.</p>
<p>Benign intracranial hypertension pseudotumor cerebri , confusion, depression, optic neuritis , and psychotic reactions have been reported rarely. Bulging fontanels, as a sign of benign intracranial hypertension in infants, have been reported rarely. In subacute pulmonary reactions, fever and eosinophilia occur less often than in the acute form.</p>
<p>Upon cessation of therapy, recovery may require several months. If the symptoms are not recognized as being drug-related and nitrofurantoin therapy is not stopped, the symptoms may become more severe. Acute pulmonary reactions are commonly manifested by fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltration with consolidation or pleural effusion on x-ray , and eosinophilia.</p>
<p>Acute reactions usually occur within the first week of treatment and are reversible with cessation of therapy. Resolution often is dramatic. Changes in EKG e. Cyanosis has been reported rarely. Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis , cholestatic jaundice , chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis , occur rarely. Lupus -like syndrome associated with pulmonary reaction to nitrofurantoin has been reported.</p>
<p>Also, angioedema ; maculopapular, erythematous, or eczematous eruptions; anaphylaxis ; arthralgia ; myalgia ; drug fever; chills; and vasculitis sometimes associated with pulmonary reactions have been reported. Hypersensitivity reactions represent the most frequent spontaneously-reported adverse events in worldwide postmarketing experience with nitrofurantoin formulations.</p>
<p>Exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported rarely. Cyanosis secondary to methemoglobinemia has been reported rarely. As with other antimicrobial agents, superinfections caused by resistant organisms, e.</p>
<p>The following laboratory adverse events also have been reported with the use of nitrofurantoin:</p></p>
