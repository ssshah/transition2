		<p><p>In a separate filing, Purdue claims that controlled-release oxycodone "provides pain relief in said patient for at least 12 hours after administration. Doctors in the s often would switch their patients to a dosing schedule of once every eight hours when they complained that the duration of action for OxyContin was too short to be only taken twice a day.</p>
<p>Purdue's medical director Robert Reder wrote to one doctor in that "OxyContin has been developed for q12h dosing I request that you not use a q8h dosing regimen. One such memo read, "There is no Q8 dosing with OxyContin Los Angeles Times journalists argue using interviews from opioid addiction experts that such high doses of OxyContin spaced 12 hours apart create a combination of agony during opiate withdrawal lower lows and a schedule of reinforcement that relieves this agony, fostering addiction.</p>
<p>The chemical structures are very similar, differing only in that Oxycodone has a hydroxy group at carbon codeine has just a hydrogen in its place Oxycodone has a 7,8-dihydro feature. Codeine has a double bond between those two carbons; and Oxycodone has a carbonyl group as in ketones in place of the hydroxyl group of codeine.</p>
<p>It is also similar to hydrocodone , differing only in that it has a hydroxyl group at carbon The free base conversion ratios of different salts are: The hydrochloride salt is the basis of most American oxycodone products whilst bitartrate, tartrate, pectinate, terephthalate and phosphate salts are also available in European products. Methyiodide and hydroiodide are mentioned in older European publications. Biosynthesis In terms of biosynthesis, oxycodone has been found naturally in nectar extracts from the orchid family Epipactis helleborine ; together along with another opioid: Many commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with oxycodone and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish oxycodone from other opiates.</p>
<p>It was hoped that a thebaine -derived drug would retain the analgesic effects of morphine and heroin with less dependence. Unfortunately, this was ultimately not found to be the case. The first clinical use of the drug was documented in , the year after it was first developed. Theodor Morell , indicate Hitler received repeated injections of "eukodal" oxycodone. Many chronic pain sufferers won't take OxyContin for fear of becoming addicted, and some health care providers refuse to write OxyContin prescriptions for fear of being prosecuted.</p>
<p>WebMD talked to experts about OxyContin as a legitimate medication for moderate to severe pain, the dangers of abuse, the issue of addiction , and the climate of suspicion that restricts patients' access to the drug. OxyContin Use and Abuse OxyContin is the brand name for a timed-release formula of oxycodone , a narcotic analgesic medication that reduces pain. It's used to relieve pain from injuries, arthritis , cancer , and other conditions. Oxycodone, a morphine -like drug, is found along with non-narcotic analgesics in a number of prescription drugs, such as Percodan oxycodone and aspirin and Percocet oxycodone and acetaminophen.</p>
<p>OxyContin contains between 10 and 80 milligrams of oxycodone in a timed-release formula that allows up to 12 hours of relief from chronic pain. What distinguished OxyContin from other analgesics was its long-acting formula, a blessing for patients who typically need round-the-clock relief. People tend not to take their pills on time. The pain builds back up, so you're starting over. It's not very good management of pain. We do need opioids. People who abuse the drug crush the tablet and swallow or snort it, or dilute it in water and inject it.</p>
<p>This destroys the time-release mechanism so that the user gets the full effects of the narcotic. Users compare the high to the euphoria of heroin. Continued "What makes OxyContin dangerous is not only that it's addictive, it can also be lethal," says Drew Pinsky, MD, best known for his Loveline radio show. According to the U. But with the introduction of OxyContin in , there has been a marked escalation of abuse. However, the DEA says the problem has spread across the country.</p>

Taking this medicine during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Fatal side effects can occur if you use this medicine with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.</p>

To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Some medicines can interact with oxycodone and cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome.</p>
<p>Be sure your doctor knows if you also take stimulant medicine, herbal products , or medicine for depression , mental illness, Parkinson's disease , migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications. If you use oxycodone while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born.</p>
<p>Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Oxycodone can pass into breast milk and may cause drowsiness, breathing problems, or death in a nursing baby. How should I use oxycodone? Take oxycodone exactly as prescribed.
