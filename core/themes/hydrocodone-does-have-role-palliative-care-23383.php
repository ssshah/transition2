		<p><p>Both hydrocodone and codeine are opioid, or narcotic, painkillers. This means that they operate by attaching to opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, spinal cord, brain, and other organs. Once attached, they interrupt pain signals, diminishing the pain experienced by the user.</p>
<p>Why Are They Being Misused? Some are given so many prescriptions that they get confused and misuse them. Others are experiencing some form of cognitive decline and this can cause them to use their medication in ways other than prescribed.</p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons. Many seniors become addicted due to having too many prescriptions to keep track of. But, there is only one certain solution to the problems of dependence and addiction.</p>
<p>Radiation or region- where is the primary location and does it radiate? Severity— verbal descriptors or how severe is pain on a scale of ? Treatment— what are current or past treatments and or side effects? Understanding- meaning of pain to the sufferer, total pain. Some validated and user-friendly tools may help you in this assessment such as the Brief Pain Inventory.</p>
<p>Palliative patients often present with several pain locations and types, and each of them needs to be assessed separately. Ideally, patients and families should bring in all the pill bottles to avoid confusion or polypharmacy. Assess past regimens with dosage, mode of administration, duration of treatment, effectiveness, and side effects. Assess allergies and particular reactions. Assess history of palliative chemotherapy or radiation therapy, PT, psychotherapy, hypnosis, cognitive behavioural therapy, etc.</p>
<p>The evaluation should include: If you follow this checklist, you should have the background information to conduct a problem-oriented physical exam and be able to determine what lab or imaging may be required to learn more about the cause of pain, so that you are able to determine appropriate treatment options.</p>
<p>The pharmacological options are described below; references on non-pharmacological or interventional options are available. Pharmacological options There are three categories of pain medications as per the WHO pain ladder,  It should be the first step of the treatment if the pain level is mild. It may also be considered a good medication to add to an opioid treatment and has been included in several prescription medications. Due to the concern of hepatic toxicity, the FDA strongly cautions against excess use of combination treatments, such as Percocet or Vicodin, with a maximum dosage limited to mg of acetaminophen per dosage unit; in addition, a boxed warning will highlight potential for severe liver failure, the mg dosage will be by prescription only and the present recommendation is mg acetaminophen QID maximum.</p>
<p>The FDA has a maximum of 4 gms daily, however, this is lowered to 2 gms in liver disease and only for a limited time. More recently, cardiac risks such as myocardial infarction and stroke have also been reported, and the FDA has strengthened their existing label warning. The options which are considered as the safest nowadays are ibuprofen and naproxen.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to prescribe a short course of treatment e. Proton pump inhibitors may be considered in conjunction for certain situations. The use of COX-2 selective agents, which may have a reduced risk of GI bleeding, is not recommended in palliative care, as the dosage required to obtain an appropriate pain control should be increased to a level where the side effects are equivalent to lower doses of non-selective NSAIDs.</p>
<p>Expense and adverse cardiovascular events have limited dramatically its use in general over the years. The WHO pain ladder targeting specifically cancer pain has been a reference for a long time suggesting to step up from a non opioid to a "weak" opioid if the pain was not relieved and then only to a strong one if once again the pain control was not satisfactory. Nowadays, however, due to the usual high level of pain presented by palliative patients, and based on our deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of pain, as well as on the increased amount of new therapeutic formulations, stronger opioids may be indicated earlier.</p>
<p>Some other individuals are, on the contrary, ultra-rapid metabolizers and may have an increased risk of side effects. The only indication for codeine remains its action against cough, probably through its pro-drug. Not considered to be "at risk" for addiction due its weak action on the mu opioid receptors, so is not a Schedule II drug.</p>
<p>Due to its blockage of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, may have an additional benefit in neuropathic pain. However, there are several limitations: More recently, the FDA issued a warning regarding the risk of suicidality in a population with risk factors which are very frequent in palliative care.</p>
<p>There is also a major risk of serotoninergic syndrome due to interactions with SSRI or tricyclic antidepressants. Be careful in patients with renal impairment due to one of its active metabolites, M3G, which may lead to opioid-related toxicity please refer to the next section. It is metabolized to hydromorphone, and the CYP 2D6 may alter analgesic response.</p>
<p>It is very useful for parenteral use as it requests smaller volumes. As morphine, it has an active metabolite H3G which may lead to neurotoxicity at high doses or if renal impairment.</p>
<p>Top of Page Social Worker The social worker helps the person and the family deal with the personal and social problems of illness, disability and impending death. The social worker helps by setting up family meetings to discuss hopes and goals, makes referralys to community services ex: Before or after death the social worker also helps the family think of ways to take care of themselves and coping with loss and grief.</p>
<p>They help in identifying and expressing spiritual issues, help with the search for meaning the the person's life, and celebrate life in the midst of pain and suffering. The chaplain helps the person reflect on faith and matters of faith such as prayer and ritual, networks with community faith groups may provide support in the planning of memorial or funeral services The chaplain must respect ALL faiths, is caring, sensitive and supportive to people during illness, grief and bereavement and is a good listener who affirms a person's worth.</p>
<p>Top of Page Pharmacist The pharmacist can give advice on the side effects of the medication, teach the person and the family how to take the medication and what to do if there are side effects, give the doctor advice on how to give the medication, help set up a schedule for taking medications, prepare the medication, and provide ongoing monitoring of all medications. Top of Page Respiratory Therapist A respiratory therapist can look after and follow a person who is having breathing problems, advise and teach on the use of oxygen, suctioning and medications to help with breathing and help to get oxygen at home for the person.</p>
<p>June 5, 2: It is thought to act by binding to calcium channels and modulating calcium influx, or by blocking new synapse formation. Neuropathic pain tends to be chronic, is complex, and can be difficult to treat effectively. Treatment often involves pharmacologic and physical therapies, although conventional analgesics may not be effective. September 26, Drug Misuse: Opioid Detoxification The guideline on Drug misuse: Of the estimated 4 million people in the UK who use illicit drugs each year, approximately 50, misuse opioids such as heroin, opium, morphine, codeine and methadone.</p>
<p>Opioid misuse presents a considerable health risk and can lead to significant social problems. This NICE guideline is an important tool in helping people to overcome their drug problem.</p></p>
