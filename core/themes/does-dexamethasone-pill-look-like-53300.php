            <h1>Does dexamethasone pill look like - Dexamethasone side effects and concerns</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>By interfering with the patient's immune response, dexamethasone can impede the effectiveness of vaccinations. Dexamethasone can also interfere with the tuberculin TB skin test and cause falsely negative results in patients with dormant tuberculosis infection. Dexamethasone impairs calcium absorption and new bone formation.</p>
<p>Patients on prolonged treatment with dexamethasone and other corticosteroids can develop osteoporosis and an increased risk of bone fractures. Supplemental calcium and vitamin D are encouraged to slow this process of bone thinning.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated in some groups of patients treated with steroids that the loss of bone may be prevented by treatment with biphosphonate drugs , for example, alendronate Fosamax. In rare individuals, destruction of large joints can occur while undergoing treatment with dexamethasone or other corticosteroids. These patients experience severe pain in the involved joints, and can require joint replacements.</p>
<p>The reason behind such destruction is not clear. Dosage requirements of corticosteroids vary greatly among individuals and the diseases being treated. In general, the lowest possible effective dose is used. Endocrine Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal HPA axis suppression with the potential for corticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment.</p>
<p>Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased.</p>
<p>Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. Infections General Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals.</p>
<p>There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. These infections may be mild to severe. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control life-threatening drug reactions.</p>
<p>Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents. Special Pathogens Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma.</p>
<p>It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea.</p>
<p>Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides threadworm infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis The use of corticosteroids in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen.</p>
<p>If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.</p>
<p>Viral infections Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin VZIG may be indicated.</p>
<p>If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immune globulin IG may be indicated. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered. Ophthalmic Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement. Cardio-Renal As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.</p>
<p>Endocrine Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. In order to clarify I asked her why she wanted the drug and she said she wanted her butt to grow bigger. With growing confidence she informed me that her friend used it and it worked. What she wanted was available in other brands nonetheless, I didn't offer her that option because I knew her only intention was to abuse the drug.</p>
<p>I advised not to use the medication and tried to explain to her the dangers of abusing the drugs but in response she raised her voice and said she was going to get the drug elsewhere. You may begin to wonder what my reasons were for refusing to give her the medication.</p>
<p>These are the reasons: Dexamethasone is actually indicated for use in conditions such as severe allergies when regular allergy medications are ineffective , hypercalcemia associated with cancer, thyroiditis and so on.</p>
<p>The tablet has never been indicated for booty enlargement. When Dexamethasone is abused the following results; Cushigs syndrome: Rapid weight gain especially in the trunk, back stomach b. Moon face fat on the shoulders and neck with a round moon-shaped face c.</p>
<p>Thin skin and stretch marks d.</p></p>

What value would the stuff have been to an ENT doctor, and like sort of emergency might Frank have feared? For look, I do not know of any tablet look a confirmed safety profile that helps with butt enlargement, <i>does dexamethasone pill look like</i>. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free <b>pill</b> rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these does. Dosage for adrenal insufficiency Adult dosage ages 18 years and older Typical dosage: Avoid contact with people dexamethasone have recently received oral polio vaccine or flu vaccine inhaled through the nose. I don't have the time to spare, otherwise I'd make it even better! Does It Really Work? The <b>pill</b> you gained will not be entirely from the dexamethasone, but also in part due to the reduced <i>doe</i> following your surgery and this I hope should now be improving anyway. Special <i>dexamethasone</i> should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis e.</p><br clear="left" />
