        </div>
	 
		<p><p>To find out if you have an infection caused by this type of bacteria, your doctor will test a sample of fluid from your vagina or urethra. If you do, you'll get treated with antibiotics such as one in the tetracycline family, like doxycycline.</p>
<p>To help keep this infection away, always use a condom during sex. And limit how many partners you have. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum Most healthy women have these bacteria in their cervix or vagina, and a smaller number of men also have them in their urethra. Normally, they don't cause any problems.</p>
<p>Ureaplasma can spread during sex. If you're pregnant and you're infected, you can pass the bacteria to your baby in the womb or during childbirth. Some symptoms women can get are: It hurts when you pee Belly pain Pain, odor, or discharge from the vagina Swelling at the opening of the urethra Discharge from the urethra Continued Men who are infected can get inflammation of the urethra, called urethritis.</p>
<p>Rhabdomyolysis with or without renal impairment has been reported in seriously ill patients receiving erythromycin concomitantly with lovastatin. Therefore, patients receiving concomitant lovastatin and erythromycin should be carefully monitored for creatine kinase CK and serum transaminase levels see package insert for lovastatin.</p>
<p>Precautions General Prescribing Erythromycin Tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving erythromycin therapy.</p>
<p>There have been reports of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis IHPS occurring in infants following erythromycin therapy. A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 5.</p>
<p>Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. Prolonged or repeated use of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p>
<p>When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Observational studies in humans have reported cardiovascular malformations after exposure to drug products containing erythromycin during early pregnancy. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Erythromycin Tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections e. When Erythromycin Tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may 1 decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and 2 increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Erythromycin Tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p>
<p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools with or without stomach cramps and fever even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic.</p>
<p>If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Theophylline Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to co-administration of theophylline could result in subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin.</p>
<p>Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with oral anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly.</p>
<p>Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p enzyme system CYP3A. Co-administration of erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions.</p>
<p>Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: Triazolobenzodiazepines such as triazolam and alprazolam and related benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Sildenafil Viagra Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure AUC of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered see Viagra package insert. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methyl-prednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.</p>
<p>If none of these criteria are present, empiric treatment of symptomatic males is recommended only for men at high risk for infection who are unlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation. Such patients should be treated with drug regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.</p>
<p>Partners of patients treated empirically should be evaluated and treated, if indicated. Nongonococcal Urethritis Diagnosis All patients who have confirmed or suspected urethritis should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Testing for chlamydia is strongly recommended because of the increased utility and availability of highly sensitive and specific testing methods e. Treatment Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Azithromycin and doxycycline are highly effective for chlamydial urethritis; however, infections with M. Single-dose regimens have the advantage of improved compliance and directly observed treatment. To maximize compliance with recommended therapies, medications should be dispensed on-site in the clinic, and the first dose should be directly observed. Recommended Regimens Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose OR Doxycycline mg orally twice a day for 7 days Alternative Regimens Erythromycin base mg orally four times a day for 7 days OR Erythromycin ethylsuccinate mg orally four times a day for 7 days OR Levofloxacin mg orally once daily for 7 days OR Ofloxacin mg orally twice a day for 7 days To minimize transmission, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen, provided their symptoms have resolved.</p>
<p>To minimize the risk for reinfection, men should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their sex partners are treated. Persons who have been diagnosed with a new STD should receive testing for other infections, including syphilis and HIV. Follow-Up Patients should be instructed to return for evaluation if symptoms persist or recur after completion of therapy.</p>
<p>Symptoms alone, without documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral inflammation, are not a sufficient basis for retreatment. However, because men with documented chlamydial or gonococcal infections have a high rate of reinfection within 6 months after treatment , , repeat testing of all men diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea is recommended 3—6 months after treatment, regardless of whether patients believe that their sex partners were treated  Partner Referral A specific diagnosis might facilitate partner referral.</p>
<p>Therefore, testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia is encouraged. Because a substantial proportion of female partners of males with nonchlamydial NGU are infected with chlamydia, partner management is recommended for males with NGU regardless of whether a specific etiology is identified.</p>
<p>All sex partners within the preceding 60 days should be referred for evaluation, testing, and empiric treatment with a drug regimen effective against chlamydia.</p>
<p>Expedited partner treatment and patient referral are alternative approaches to treating partners  Recurrent and Persistent Urethritis Objective signs of urethritis should be present before the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. In persons who have persistent symptoms after treatment without objective signs of urethritis, the value of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p>Persons who have persistent or recurrent urethritis can be retreated with the initial regimen if they did not comply with the treatment regimen or if they were reexposed to an untreated sex partner.</p></p>
