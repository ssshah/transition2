		<p><p>A review states that, "alternative therapies i. Vitamin C prophylaxis may modestly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold in the general population and may reduce the incidence of the illness in persons exposed to physical and environmental stresses. The FDA therefore discourages its use. This was quickly realized to be not true as heroin readily breaks down into morphine in the body.</p>
<p>Excessive sweating can also cause you to wake up frequently throughout the night, contributing to sleeping difficulties and daytime fatigue. Symptoms of sweating during hydrocodone withdrawal may occur in conjunction with fever or chills in some people. Stomach Upset While you are undergoing hydrocodone withdrawal, you can develop stomach-related symptoms that may be unpleasant. Urine or blood tests to screen for drugs can confirm opiate use.</p>
<p>Blood chemistries and liver function tests such as CHEM CBC complete blood count, measures red and white blood cells, and platelets, which help blood to clot Chest x-ray EKG electrocardiogram, or heart tracing Testing for hepatitis C , HIV , and tuberculosis TB , as many people who abuse opiates also have these diseases Treatment Withdrawal from these drugs on your own can be very hard and may be dangerous. Treatment most often involves medicines, counseling, and support.</p>
<p>You and your health care provider will discuss your care and treatment goals. With help from Dr. Carlos Tirado, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Austin and clinical director of chemical dependency services at Seton Shoal Creek Hospital, here are 5 signs someone you love might be abusing prescription painkillers and how to help: Five signs a loved one is abusing painkillers An overactive thyroid gland can cause restlessness and irritability.</p>
<p>An underactive thyroid can make kids lethargic. Thyroid disease strikes kids of all ages, but is most common in high schoolers, says Dr.</p>
<p>Drowsiness, lack of energy One potential sign a person may be addicted to opioids is that he or she looks tired, and that drowsiness causes the person to spend less time with old friends and skip out on activities. Tirado says during the peak effect of using opioids, a drug-taker might appear drowsy with drooping eyes or may look about to fall asleep.</p>
<p>If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen. If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient s and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose.</p>
<p>This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child. Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.</p>
<p>If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children. Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive.</p>
<p>Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Because it has the highest amount of hydrocodone and lowest amount of acetaminophen it will allow for a slightly higher total daily tablet count.</p>
<p>The most popular By far, the most frequently prescribed version of these products is Vicodin. What about the cost? Another way to compare them is by cost. Typically Vicodin the generic form is the least expensive of the bunch.</p></p>
