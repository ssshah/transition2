		<p><p>Propecia is used to halt this process and help treat and even reverse the effects of male pattern baldness. This drug is not intended for women or children and as such, has the potential to cause serious harm if used by this particular demographic. Even handling this drug can cause it to be absorbed through the skin, so it needs to be kept way from anyone but men. Can stress cause hair loss? Side effects with a standard 1mg daily dose are rare and usually not permanent.</p>
<p>Some men have demonstrated some form of sexual dysfunction such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction or decreased volume of ejaculate.</p>
<p>However these results do not vary significantly from men treated with a placebo in actual studies, so reports on many Internet sites appear to be highly exaggerated. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you: Problems with ejaculation that continue after stopping medication have been reported infrequently.</p>

Used by millions of men worldwide, finasteride which is widely known as Propecia is one of the few proven medications on the market for preventing and, in some cases, reversing hair loss.</p>
<p>Over time, DHT can damage your hair follicles , resulting in long-term hair loss. All of the hairs you lose due to male pattern baldness are affected by DHT. Since finasteride works by reducing total DHT levels , it should logically prevent you from losing hair around your hairline. However, the prescribing information for finasteride mostly focuses on its ability to prevent hair loss on the crown and top of the head.</p>
<p>Receding Hairlines and DHT: DHT is the primary hormone that causes hair loss in men. Some men are more sensitive to DHT than others, which is why not everyone begins to lose their hair at the same time, or at the same speed. Hair loss can start at the hairline , at the crown or on top of the head. The area in which you start to lose hair is determined by your genetics -- in some men, the hair around their hairline are the most sensitive to DHT, while in others, the area around the crown starts to thin first.</p>
<p>Instead of affecting a specific part of your scalp or blocking a specific type of hair loss, it will block DHT at its source. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products.</p>
<p>Do not start a new medication without telling your doctor. Where can I get more information? Your pharmacist can provide more information about finasteride. During the 7- year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial PCPT that enrolled 18, men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo.</p>
<p>The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy.</p>
<p>Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride.</p>
