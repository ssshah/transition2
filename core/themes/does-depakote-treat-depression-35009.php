        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Sometimes I feel like I'm going to fall into unconsciousness. My palms will sweat and I will loose my ability to focus and become nervous. This usually happens when I'm in a situation I find uncomfortable. Another thing that has happened is that I've been getting migraines. The only time they happen is after I've gone for a run. I've had 5 migraines in the last 3 or 4 years after running.</p>
<p>I know that isn't many but it's really odd that they occur after I run. Even short 2 mile runs. I took Paxil a few years ago and Xanax a few years back when this all first started. It seemed to work but now my doctor is suggesting Depakote and Ativan this time around. I've read that many of the symptoms I feel are due to a lack of serotonin. I thought about taking a serotonin supplement as an alternative to the meds.</p>
<p>All I want is to be able to live a somewhat normal life. Hopefully Depakote will help. Hopefully it will help you too.
