		<p><p>Not everyone will experience this energy drop, but it can be difficult to deal with for those that do. Some individuals may be plagued by side effects such as sleepiness and increased fatigue.</p>
<p>The increase in fatigue may make it very difficult to get proper exercise and burn calories. Those who feel fatigued may end up lying around more than usual and sleeping more frequently — which will lead to weight gain. SSRIs work by increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a chemical that helps to regulate a person's mood. Lexapro comes in the form of either a liquid or pills.</p>
<p>The recommended dose is usually 10 milligrams mg , which people should take once a day in the morning or the evening. The medication usually takes 4—6 weeks to work, and a person may need to take it for months or years. Lexapro is safe to take over an extended period. But as a side effect , some of these drugs may affect your weight.</p>
<p>There are some reports that people begin to lose weight when first taking Lexapro, but this finding is not well supported by research studies. This may be because study participants taking Lexapro had fewer binge-eating episodes. More thorough research is needed on the topic of Lexapro and weight changes.</p>
<p>Continued Antidepressants and Weight Gain: The Diet and Exercise Link Not surprisingly, experts also say that some of the same tenets that help us control our weight under normal circumstances may also help us while using antidepressants -- including eating healthy and getting enough exercise.</p>
<p>If, in fact, you've already started packing on the extra pounds, Heller says switching to a healthier diet, cutting calories, and increasing exercise are still worth the effort. Moreover, a steadily growing body of scientific evidence suggests that increasing your daily exercise may affect not only weight loss, but also help your depression.</p>
<p>In one large study of more than 3, Finnish men and women published in the journal Preventive Medicine, researchers found that those who exercised at least two to three times a week experienced significantly less depression, anger, and stress than those who exercised less frequently or not at all. Experts warn, however, not to severely restrict caloric intake while taking antidepressants.</p>

The good news is, I feel great — happy, peaceful and can think clearly.</p>
<p>I just have to figure out how to stop gaining and get back into the clothes that no longer fit me! Reply Link Kennedy January 31, ,  I did not change my eating habits, and I exercise like I use to before I started taking Lexapro. I went from weighing to weighing  In this study, the weight gain experienced by people taking citalopram averaged one to two pounds.</p>
<p>Compared to citalopram, the weight gain linked to other antidepressants was small. Bupropion was associated with the least amount of weight gain, close to none.</p>
<p>Two others that also appeared to have less weight gain were amitriptyline and nortriptyline. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are older drugs.</p></p>
		
		<h2>Lexapro and Weight Gain or Loss</h2>
		<p>Reply Link Bryan March 28,9: Going out to eat often is an easy way to over-eat, eat unhealthy, lexapro gain weight. The only SSRI to cause some initial weight loss before weight gain was fluoxetine. Lexapro belongs to a class of antidepressants called <i>likely</i> serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs.

I was also on Wellbutrin at the time.
