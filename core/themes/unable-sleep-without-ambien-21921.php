        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Schweigert had a job that required a security clearance. She had never been in trouble with the law before and was terrified of losing her job and having a criminal record.</p>
<p>The next morning, you may not remember that you did anything during the nightâ€¦Reported activities include: Prosecutors dropped the charges and allowed Lindsey to plead to the lesser charge of careless driving, which meant that she could keep her security clearance. The court agreed, saying that it would be an "injustice to hold her responsible for the undisclosed side effects of a popular and readily available medication that she was lawfully prescribed and properly administered.</p>
<p>In April of , Bronson took a couple of Ambien to help her sleep. She had been drinking wine earlier in the day, and went to bed early. She awoke the following morning in jail, still in her pajamas, barefoot and terrified. When she was told that she had run over three people, including an month-old girl who suffered severe brain damage as a result of the wreck, she was horrified.</p>
<p>It was like a bad dream. And if I would have hit somebody, I would have stopped and helped. Not all prosecutors will consider the Ambien defense, and its position within established criminal rules is tenuous.</p>
<p>The Ambien defendants knowingly took the drug, but they were not aware that they were drugging themselves in a way that could produce anything other than sleep. The defendants knowingly took the medication, and the reactions, although surprising, were not unpredictable because they are listed as potential side effects in the prescribing information. The whole motivation for taking Ambien in the first place is presumably to cause unconsciousness so this defense doesn't really apply either.</p>
<p>Ironically, you are more likely to be successful using the Ambien defense if you injure or kill someone than if you just crash into a parked car or a tree. Other research has shown that persistent insomnia lasting for six years or longer is associated with an increased risk of death. Sleep Restriction Therapy Purposely restricting sleep might sound like the last thing an insomniac should do. But sleep restriction is actually one of the primary components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I, a method the American College of Physicians recommends as the first-line treatment for adults with insomnia.</p>
<p>This serves to strengthen the mind-body connection between the act of getting in bed and falling asleep quickly. First figure out how many hours you typically sleep in a night. Tack 30 minutes onto that number and spend only that amount of time in bed. While it may take some time to achieve a completely normal sleep pattern, most individuals see an improvement within four to five weeks, and the results are usually long-lasting.</p>
<p>Relaxation Techniques Stress is one of the most common underlying causes of insomnia, and unhealthy levels of stress also increase the risk of relapse after substance abuse treatment. Chronic worrying about health, work, relationships and other matters affects us physically by causing the release of stress hormones that increase heart rate, body temperature and muscle tension. Unfortunately, this heightened state of arousal can make sleep difficult, if not impossible. Making matters worse, many people also tend to ruminate over their inability to sleep.</p>
<p>I stopped the ambien that night. Two days prior to that I was put on 1mg Xanax q6hrs. I don't like the way I feel during the day, so I don't take it as prescribed. I took 2 Xanax before bed the night I stopped the Ambien and actually got 6 hrs sleep!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it! So far, thank God I've been getting about 6 hrs consecutive sleep OR if I have to go to the bathroom, I can fall right asleep, which I never could before.</p>
<p>I don't know why this is, or how long it will last. I've had 3 sleep studies; each shows I kick my legs every 30 seconds and never go into a deep sleep. The "experts" never had a concrete answer or solution for me. My heart goes out to you. It's pure Hell not to be able to sleep. I'm sorry to read that such a long time passed of taking meds and nothing working. Hopefully you are on a diff. Do you get ANY hours of consecutive sleep? My doctor is great, he asked about things I've tried and he told me to try Ambien.</p>
<p>Well, talk about fantastic I took it last night after trying to fall asleep naturally and failing, and within 45 minutes I was blissfully asleep. I slept the entire night, something I haven't been able to do. It works wonders for me, although I haven't been on it enough to know if it will continue to work and I am aware of the limitations of this drug shouldn't take it more than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>If you have a doctor willing to let you try it, I would highly recommend you do so. Make sure you take it about an hour before you want to be in bed sleeping.</p>
<p>And if you do take this, do not resist the urge to fall asleep One night I felt like my bedroom was a rocket ship and if I were to open my bedroom door I would be in outer space This medication is absolutely frightening.</p>
<p>I had no idea there was even a problem. Use at risk of yourself and those around you. I now have a criminal record and am just glad no one got physically hurt. I take it times a week when I know I need decent sleep.</p></p>
