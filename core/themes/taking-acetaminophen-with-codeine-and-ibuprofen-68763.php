		<p><p>If someone accidentally swallows this drug, get medical help right away. One ingredient in this product is acetaminophen. Taking too much acetaminophen may cause serious possibly fatal liver disease. Adults should not take more than milligrams 4 grams of acetaminophen a day.</p>
<p>People with liver problems and children should take less acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how much acetaminophen is safe to take. Do not use with any other drug containing acetaminophen without asking your doctor or pharmacist first. Check the labels on all your medicines to see if they contain acetaminophen, and ask your pharmacist if you are unsure. Get medical help right away if you take too much acetaminophen overdose , even if you feel well.</p>
<p>Daily alcohol use, especially when combined with acetaminophen, may damage your liver. Before using this medication, women of childbearing age should talk with their doctor s about the risks and benefits.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. During pregnancy , this medication should be used only when clearly needed. It may slightly increase the risk of birth defects if used during the first two months of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Also, using it for a long time or in high doses near the expected delivery date may harm the unborn baby. Even OTC drugs carry a risk of side effects, and by taking two or more together you could be increasing that risk or even putting yourself in danger of an overdose.</p>
<p>In fact, in Europe there are products that combine the two. But one study shows the combination could potentially increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. In a British study published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups -- acetaminophen only, ibuprofen only, a low dose of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and high dose of acetaminophen and ibuprofen — and then evaluated after 10 days and again after three months.</p>
<p>While the group taking the high-dose combination pill experienced the biggest improvements in pain relief, stiffness, function and quality of life at both check-ups, that pain relief came at a cost.</p>
<p>At the end of the week trial,  The researchers write that they are concerned that there may be a synergistic — and not just additive — effect between ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the combination pills that potentially leads to GI bleeding.</p>
<p>Moore was not involved with the study. Combining Seemingly Unrelated Products But knowingly combining two different pain relievers is not the only risky practice. The same goes for acetaminophen , which can be found in a number of OTC cold formulations, headache remedies and cough medicines. Consuming high doses of acetaminophen — long believed not to irritate the GI system — also can cause GI bleeding, the British study found.</p></p>
