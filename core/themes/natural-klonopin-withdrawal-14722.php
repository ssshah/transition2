            <h1>Withdrawal from benzodiazepines like Klonopin is considered There are serious dangers to seeking home remedies as a natural alternative for Klonopin withdrawal.</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Video of the Day Several medicinal herbs may act as viable alternatives to this strong prescription drug. Your health care provider may recommend any of several herbs to treat anxiety, but you should never change medication or stop taking Klonopin without telling your doctor. With the approval of your licensed practitioner, consider any of the following natural alternatives to Klonopin. Kava The Pacific herb kava-kava may be the most viable, evidence-based natural alternative to Klonopin.</p>
<p>According to MedlinePlus, kava is roughly as effective as the prescription drug Buspar for relieving symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder GAD. MedlinePlus also references preliminary evidence suggesting that kava rivals the efficacy of benzodiazepines like Klonopin and Valium.</p>
<p>While kava's efficacy has been well-documented, concerns exist regarding its safety. It remains a good and reliable anti anxiety formulation that you can take and feel safe and at the same time be relieved of that problem. The anti anxiety medication was considered effective and safe, because of the natural ingredients used in formulating it, which include L Theanine.</p>
<p>This is a known ingredient that reduces physical and mental stress. Furthermore, it contains B complex vitamins. This helps to restore the vitamin levels in the body. Moreover, it makes for improved nutrition and mental health. Another important ingredient is ashwangadha. This also reduces stress. Furthermore, the product contains Valerian. It reduces stress relating to twitches and muscle tension. Finally, it contains GABA, which is another popular natural ingredient that does away with anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>Thousands of people who have used the product have testified that it works wonders. It could reduce stress and worries without adverse side effect, and that is why it is strongly recommended. MoodBoost Millions of people suffer from depression from all parts of the globe. Most of the medications used for it are counterproductive, because they have adverse side effects.</p>
<p>These effects are therapeutic at lower levels of the drug. Benzodiazepines such as Klonopin also produce feelings of mild euphoria and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Klonopin and other Schedule IV substances have a potential for abuse and the development of physical dependence. They can only be legally obtained with a prescription from a physician. Withdrawal from Klonopin Because Klonopin is a high-potency benzodiazepine with a relatively short onset of action, it is used in the treatment of serious anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder.</p>
<p>However, these properties also leave open the potential for the development of a serious physical dependence on Klonopin. Other system functions compensate to operate for the presence of the drug, and the release and maintenance of freestanding levels of neurotransmitters, hormones, and the functioning levels of all systems in the body are adjusted according to the presence of the drug. This situation results in the physical withdrawal symptoms that occur when one stops taking Klonopin.</p>
<p>The physical withdrawal symptoms are accompanied by emotional and behavioral symptoms that are very uncomfortable for the person. Several variables affect the individual presentation of withdraw al from Klonopin in individuals who abuse the drug. It is important to note that benzodiazepines like Klonopin are more often secondary drugs of abuse that are used in conjunction with some other primary drug, such as alcohol or narcotic medications.</p>
<p>When there is polydrug abuse to substances that also carry a high risk for physical dependence, the withdrawal process is much more complicated. Variance in human physiology and psychological makeup can affect the intensity and length of withdrawal symptoms. The length of time the individual abused Klonopin will influence the length and intensity of withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>The frequency of use and dosage used also affect the withdrawal process. The most often cited depiction of withdrawal from Klonopin or any benzodiazepine indicates that withdrawal really occurs in two major steps. That being said, benzodiazepine withdrawal is generally considered to occur in two stages: This period occurs within a period of days following last use, depending on the half-life of the benzodiazepine.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines with longer half-lives will result in the appearance of acute withdrawal systems later than benzodiazepines with shorter half-lives. Klonopin has a half-life elimination of 40 hours, so individuals may not begin to feel serious acute withdrawal symptoms for a day or two following discontinuation. The other variable that affects the onset of acute withdrawal from Klonopin is the frequency and dosage of use. The more often and higher the dose used, the sooner the withdrawal symptoms will appear.</p>
<p>Because Klonopin has a high potential for physical dependence, it is quite possible that abusers of the drug were taking very high doses very frequently, and withdrawal symptoms can appear in just a few hours in these individuals. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be quite variable but most often will consist of some combination of: Since benzodiazepines like Klonopin are used in the control of anxiety rebound, anxiety is a common acute effect of stopping the drug.</p>
<p>Some sources may recognize rebound anxiety as a first step in the withdrawal process from Klonopin as it often presents early in the acute withdrawal process. Full-blown or protracted withdrawal: This stage is often referred to as simply withdrawal and occurs after the acute phase, typically extending days.</p></p>
