		<p><p>All I can say is, it is worth the time. Good luck and keep trying! Reply Link Jane April 18, , 9: Still have some withdrawal issues, still some days I dip. Fresh air, exercise and lots of deep breathing along with some down time listening to positive affirmations helps my mind to change the thoughts that lead to anxiety etc. Good luck to all! Just my experience to date. Gary July 20, , 5: All withdrawal symptoms gone? Reply Link Kia Noori April 18, , 8: I get struck with depersonalization and random fear, and this was the exact reason why I went on the medication.</p>
<p>Is my brain just not okay without a certain dose 75 mg of zoloft? I was able to live my life again, and honestly as I said earlier, the medication saved my life. Maybe my brain just needs Zoloft for now? I might need it for the rest of my life? Please let me know your thoughts. Sorry I was everywhere with this comment. Reply Link Dreana April 23, , 6: It has nearly cured me. His name is Dr. He wrote a book called Brain Lock.</p>
<p>You can change your brain chemistry without drugs. Look him up on the internet for more info on him. Dreana Reply Link Jennifer April 18, , 3: I started taking them every other day for a week or two, then stopped completely.</p>
<p>I gained 35 ponds while on, and felt numb all of the time. Never again will I let a doctor convince me to take medication!!! I was anxiety ridden before but would have been fine!!! Reply Link Ali July 20, , 9: I agree the anxiety I had I could have dealt with and I wish I had never been convinced to take anything!!! Prescribed 50 mg from GP, took it for 2 weeks with no signs of helping so I stopped for 1 week.</p>
<p>Had a medical event that required a follow up with GP, she suggested I get back on. I took it for 4 days when I started experiencing horrible side effects; excessive sweating, insomnia, racing thoughts all the symptoms the fact sheet you get with the medication indicate Serotonin syndrome. Called GP today and have yet to hear back! So much for contacting your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms.</p>
<p>I decided this medicine is not for me and am now after only 3 weeks of use experiencing bouts of dizziness. I regret taking this but will work through the withdrawal and not put another one of these pills in my system again. The only thing that I can personally suggest is to be patient Keep yourself busy. If you have a dog, just keep hanging out with your dog. Put your focus on other things, or try to at least.</p>
<p>Reply Link Rupi April 15, , 8: I was on 80mg atomoxetine and mg Sertraline. Before that was on mg Sertraline. Then when I tapered down to 50 mg Sertraline I went up to mg atomoxetine. We might try something else but then atomoxetine has been proven to help in cases of comorbid anxiety and ADHD so I guess we are seeing if that works first. However I have the dizziness and the fatigue quite strongly. I have no idea how I am going to go to work on Monday. I keep getting dizzy and having to lie down.</p>
<p>Feeling very confused and overwhelmed. So I saw someone say about vitamin D… what other supplements were people talking about? What is actually impacted physiologically? Yoga is my go to. And eating three meals a day is also helpful… any more tips? Reply Link Pris April 11, , 5: I am 70 years old and am considering going off sertraline but am concerned that my body may be too old to adjust to such a change. Also, did any of you start another drug after you stopped the sertraline and if so, what was your experience?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance. Reply Link Corinna April 11, , 9: I am 34 years old and have been taking sertraline years when I stopped cold turkey at the end of January. Maybe it would help to speak to your GP and put your mind at ease? Best of luck with whatever you decide. Corinna Katrina April 25, , 4: How did you deal with the dizziness? K Reply Link Karra April 11, ,  My doctor said stop taking it and 3 days later I stared Prozac.</p>
<p>I thought I was losing my mind. I was crying, I felt like I was coming out of my skin, I felt like I was on fire… shaking. My doctor never told me that there was a withdrawal process even though I started something new. How much longer until I feel somewhat better?? Reply Link Philippa Whittingham April 8, , 7: I had come off sertraline, was feeling hellish and was worried because we were due to go to a bear sanctuary in Vietnam which I knew would be very emotional.</p>
<p>We support the charity Animals Asia. Well, I hardly dare say it, but since the visit I feel a million times better. The bears suffer truly barbaric cruelty at the hands of man, some of them have been in tiny, tiny cages for 20 years or more. But after a while at the sanctuary they learn to trust, to forgive and to be happy.</p>
<p>Not all of them of course but many. An abiding sense of love, compassion and forgiveness just pervades the place. It was pure joy being there. Go there if you can. Reply Link Corinna April 9, , 9: How did you go about doing something like that?</p>
<p>I think going back to basics and completely shutting out a lot of our first world dealings and every day society issues can achieve wonders. I grew up in Africa and we grew up so very basic and I remember it being the happiest I ever was. I was on 50mg. I am getting dizzy but nothing major [I had worse from another medication I was taking].</p>
<p>I wanted to go off the medication anyway, but should I go back on it and wean myself off, or can I just push through these few weeks? If your withdrawal symptoms are not too severe, I would persist and push on with staying off your medication. I was in the same boat. Mhmm it was ok while I was among family and busy and happy and then a couple weeks later, still being off them, I started to feel completely exhausted, angry, like I had the flu and generally crap.</p>
<p>But my head feels clearer and while I feel all these emotions and sometimes juts want to cry I also feel relieved knowing that my brain is slowly being de poisoned. I also thought about going back on them and weaning off but then weeks and weeks passed. I think patience willpower determination and lots of hugs from someone you care about are essential. Corinna Reply Link Tresa April 4, , 2: At this time my doctor switched me to Zoloft and I was taking mg and was fine.</p>
<p>After 6 months all it did was kill my sex drive and cause 25 pounds of weight gain. I went back to 75 mg of Zoloft until Feb when I was put on a new drug called Trintellix. I started on 10 mg and was miserable. After 8 days I called my doctor and she said to cut the dose in half.</p>
<p>After another month on 5 mg I felt even more miserable. All the things I tried to get rid of. Last Wednesday at work I was throwing up in the bathroom at work. I decided I was done taking this poison and stopped all medications.</p>
<p>The doctor suggested to double my dose of Trintellix and I knew that would not help. I threw up again last Friday while taking a shower. The first few days off everything I felt better however now at one week I am feeling like I am losing my mind. Anger, anxiety, and not feeling like I am going to ever feel better again.</p>
<p>So the choice at this time is do I push through another week and hope this starts to go away or give in and try yet another drug? I have Valium and take as needed for anxiety but right now I feel like I am dying. Reply Link Jane April 9, , 4: I am at 90 days and it is a slow process. I will tell you, it takes patience and time. The symptoms gradually become less and less but they are still there. I am trying as many here have suggested to: Exercise, breathing, supplements and hope.</p>
<p>This is not an easy ride. Welcome to a place where you are not alone. Read and review the comments and I hope you find your way out of this tunnel of a nightmare. Good luck and you are not alone!</p>
<p>Reply Link Michelle March 29, ,  I have experienced an electrical type feeling which coincides with seeing black spots like flashes. My mood has been ok so far, but am awaiting a fall! I have attempted reducing my medication previously with a failed attempt. I want to be completely off this horrid drug… but am unsure as to how to cope if side effects hit all of a sudden. I work full time in mental health and do not want the tapering off to affect my memory, work or anything else.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to get through this? Reply Link Chris March 31, ,  I came off of mg of sertraline, nearly a year ago now. I was on them for 15 years. Love and best wishes to you. Dreana April 11, ,  Reply Link Corinna April 11, ,  I did stop them out of the blue though so I had no gradual cutting down time. I think they all play a part. But it will — and you have to keep telling yourself that. Best of luck to you. Corinna Reply Link Dreana April 21, , 6: I have been off of Paxil for almost six months now, and am still suffering from severe anxiety.</p>
<p>But I was never this way before being on the medication and know it is not me. I heard that with some people, withdrawals can last several months and anxiety hangs on awhile. So I am hoping it will pass. But how do I get through this? Much shallow breathing all the time. Should I wait it out? Dreana Ann June 19, , 2: Reply Link Corinna March 31, , 2: I had these brain zaps as well for a couple of weeks but they are completely gone now.</p>
<p>For me fresh air and walking and music definitely help and lots of sleep and knowing that there are other people out there who are going through the exact same thing.</p>
<p>And I think everyone has a different journey. Patience is the key and not giving up. Because I know how easy it is to go back in them again. Reply Link Melissa April 7, , 6: Reply Link Corinna April 7, , 5: Yes I know exactly what you mean with the panic attacks and depersonalisation. I wish there were groups that meet in person and talk about it.</p>
<p>John April 9, , 2: Reply Link Kailash April 9, , 6: I have heard a lot of negative about supplements but Vitamin D3 in large dosage did help me in withdrawal, it did for me. I am taking IU per day. I suppose, through food or supplement, if you can correct the imbalance then it will definitely help withdrawal. All the best to everyone.</p>
<p>Link Corinna March 29, , 7: I have been on sertraline 50mg for about 5 years. I was put on after my relationship with my 2 daughters father ended. Then I met this amazing man 3 years ago and we have been in a happy relationship ever since. Zoloft oral solution is available in a multidose 60 mL bottle. Each mL of solution contains  The solution contains the following inactive ingredients: The oral solution must be diluted prior to administration [See Dosage and Administration 2. The dispenser contains dry natural rubber.</p>
<p>Zoloft - Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Sertraline potentiates serotonergic activity in the central nervous system through inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin 5-HT. Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses have demonstrated that sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets.</p>
<p>In vitro studies in animals also suggest that sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake.</p>
<p>In vitro studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity for adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, beta , cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic 5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2 , or benzodiazepine receptors. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain norepinephrine receptors. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Alcohol In healthy subjects, the acute cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol were not potentiated by Zoloft.</p>
<p>Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of sertraline on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in 54 healthy adult subjects.</p>
<p>The length of the QTc interval was also positively correlated with serum concentrations of sertraline and N- desmethylsertraline concentrations. These concentration-based analyses, however, indicated a lesser effect on QTc at maximally observed concentration than in the primary analysis [See Warnings and Precautions 5 , Adverse Reactions 6 , Drug Interactions 7 , Overdosage 10 ]. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral once-daily Zoloft dosing over the range of 50 to mg for 14 days, mean peak plasma concentrations Cmax of sertraline occurred between 4.</p>
<p>The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation up to steady-state concentrations, which are achieved after one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were demonstrated in a single dose study in which the Cmax and area under the plasma concentration time curve AUC of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 to mg.</p>
<p>The single dose bioavailability of Zoloft tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of Zoloft oral solution. Administration with food causes a small increase in Cmax and AUC. Metabolism Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to hours.</p>
<p>Both in vitro biochemical and in vivo pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC 0—hour , Cmax and Cmin, with about a 5- to 9-fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day  The half-life was similar to that in adults, and no gender-associated differences were observed [See Dosage and Administration 2.</p>
<p>Steady-state, therefore, was achieved after 2 to 3 weeks in older patients. The same study showed a decreased clearance of desmethylsertraline in older males, but not in older females [See Use in Specific Populations 8. The exposure to desmethylsertraline was approximately 2-fold greater in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to age-matched volunteers with normal hepatic function.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in plasma protein binding observed between the two groups. The effects of Zoloft in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [See Dosage and Administration 2.</p>
<p>Renal Impairment Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Thus sertraline multiple dose pharmacokinetics appear to be unaffected by renal impairment [See Use in Specific Populations 8.</p>
<p>The highest recommended pimozide dose 10 mg has not been evaluated in combination with Zoloft. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index e.</p>
<p>The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of CYP2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of MDD in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact Zoloft at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even Zoloft has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition [See Drug Interactions 7. Phenytoin Clinical trial data suggested that Zoloft may increase phenytoin concentrations [See Drug Interactions 7. Lithium In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of two doses of Zoloft did not significantly alter steady-state lithium levels or the renal clearance of lithium [See Drug Interactions 7.</p>
<p>Zoloft administration did not noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug [See Drug Interactions 7. Atenolol Zoloft mg when administered to 10 healthy male subjects had no effect on the beta-adrenergic blocking ability of atenolol [See Drug Interactions 7.</p>
<p>The results of these studies indicated that Zoloft did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride.

<p>I wish I had known what this drug would do to me before I started taking it. Please do your homework. The doctors will not tell you about the side effects and withdrawal symptoms, nor will GlaxoSmithKline, the makers of Paxil. I stopped taking Sertraline Zoloft in early January. My daily dose at that time was extremely high: By the time I stopped I was showing signs of serotonin toxicity constant anxiety and was also according to my husband and dentist grinding my teeth like crazy every night.</p>
<p>I decided to stop cold turkey, and prepared for a few bad days at least, knowing a little about potential withdrawal effects. It is now nearly three months since I stopped taking the Zoloft. I seriously contemplated stopping my car over a major bridge yesterday and jumping. My head feels heavy; I wish I could just rip it off sometimes. My head would feel light and I would get dizzy and I would get heart palpitations and then my vision would start to go so I would have to lay down very quickly.</p>
<p>I, too, have gained quite a bit of weight from being on the Zoloft. Not to mention the fact that they create brand NEW ones!!! Something really needs to be done. None of us should!! Many of these people had no mental or emotional problems to start with but were prescribed these drugs for various reasons by a family physician they trusted.</p>
<p>Side effects and withdrawal symptoms were not mentioned.</p></p>
