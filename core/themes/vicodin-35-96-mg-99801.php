Dependence and withdrawal Even if you take them exactly as prescribed, Vicodin or Percocet may become habit-forming. In other words, these drugs can cause physical or mental dependence. For this reason, doctors are cautious when prescribing them. There is also the risk of a withdrawal response when stopping these drugs.</p>
<p>If you take either drug for more than a few days, talk to your doctor before you stop. Your doctor can help you taper off the medication slowly. This reduces your risk of withdrawal. Be sure to take these drugs exactly as your doctor prescribes to reduce your risk of both dependence and withdrawal problems.</p>
<p>However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related.</p>
<p>The usual adult dosage is one tablet every four to six hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage should not exceed 6 tablets. Each tablet contains 7. They are supplied as follows: Each tablet contains 10 mg hydrocodone bitartrate and mg acetaminophen.</p>

The following adverse drug events may be borne in mind as potential effects of acetaminophen: Abuse and Dependence Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of narcotics; therefore, this product should be prescribed and administered with caution.</p>
<p>Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued narcotic use, although some mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of narcotic therapy.</p>
<p>Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia , is manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia.</p>
<p>The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.</p></p>
