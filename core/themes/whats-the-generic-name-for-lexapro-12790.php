		<p><p>Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>If concomitant treatment of Lexapro with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. The concomitant use of Lexapro with serotonin precursors such as tryptophan is not recommended. Treatment with Lexapro and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.</p>
<p>Discontinuation of Treatment with Lexapro During marketing of Lexapro and other SSRIs and SNRIs serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Lexapro.</p>
<p>A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate see Dosage and Administration. Seizures Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder.</p>
<p>These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of Lexapro, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with Lexapro treatment.</p>
<p>Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, Lexapro should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.</p>
<p>One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with Lexapro treatment. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, Lexapro should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion SIADH , and was reversible when Lexapro was discontinued.</p>
<p>Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk see Use in Specific Populations: Discontinuation of Lexapro should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls.</p>
