		<p><p>Hoping to lose 15 pounds in these first 20 days.. I have tried losing weight but nothing was working then I started steadily gaining to my current lb I am 5'4". Doctor checked my thyroid and all is well. I asked my doc about this medication and if it was right for me.</p>
<p>I will see him every 30 days, with a 3 month limit on this medication. I have been on this med for maybe 2 weeks and have not weighed myself yet, but I have definitely noticed a change in my appetite.</p>
<p>I no longer want to snack at night, and I am not always hungry. The first day I felt slightly jittery, and my mouth was so dry. Now I no longer feel jittery, my mouth is dry for about 3 hours after taking. I don't feel like I have a ton of energy, but when I get home after working a medium paced 8 hour job I am really tired when I get home. I have been keeping a close eye on my food and water intake. I am curious if I have lost any weight. I am a 46 year old male I weighed lbs the morning I started taking them and this morning I weigh lbs 25 lbs lost.</p>
<p>I started taking them because I was very athletic in my younger years and my knees are worn out I needed to lose weight before having a total knee replacement on both knees. I feel so much better that I am able to postpone the operation and I plan to lose at least 50 more lbs. If you start taking them do it on the weekend. I actually hit the gym twice this past week. Hopefully the trend continues. My goal is lb which I believe is easily attainable.</p>
<p>I just started taking my adipex today and I'm hoping to lose at least 60 pounds if not more. I already do a lot of exercises and drink nothing but water. I also already don't have much of an appetite. I have heard a lot of good things about this medication and I hope it works for me. I was considering weight loss surgery, but figured I would try this first.</p>
<p>After having my first daughter my weight sky rocketed from lb to lb then it kept going, lb was my weight in on June 14th. I had my check up this week July 17 I had lost nearly 7lbs. My doctor put me on it for another 3 months.</p>
<p>I have noticed I'm thirsty all the time, never hungry. I also have had pretty bad insomnia, but it's not affecting my mental or physical state. I have not really been dieting per say, just eating way less. The first day it made me jittery like I had a few energy drinks. I also feel like I have to get up and do stuff or else I'll go crazy. This stuff does work, but you eventually end up needing to force yourself to eat. My starting weight was 80kg lbs. In the first week I lost almost 5kgs 9lbs , but the second week I haven't lost anymore.</p>
<p>I have also started exercising 5 times a week so it could potentially be changing fat into muscle. Prior to starting adipex I wasn't exercising at all. I will update in another 2 weeks where results should be more visual. I have had some side effects including dry mouth, occassional heart palpitations, occassional long distance blurred vision. I started taking Adipex not thinking that it would work but surprisingly it did. After taking the medication for the 90 days I lost a total of 40lbs.</p>
<p>Therefore, avoid concomitant use of alcohol with Qsymia. Potential Seizures With Abrupt Withdrawal Of Qsymia Abrupt withdrawal of topiramate, a component of Qsymia, has been associated with seizures in individuals without a history of seizures or epilepsy.</p>
<p>In situations where immediate termination of Qsymia is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended. Patients With Renal Impairment Phentermine and topiramate, the components of Qsymia, are cleared by renal excretion. Adjust dose of Qsymia for both patient populations.</p>
<p>Qsymia has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. Patients With Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild Child-Pugh score 5 -6 or moderate Child-Pugh score 7 -9 hepatic impairment, exposure to phentermine was higher compared to healthy volunteers. Adjust dose of Qsymia for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Qsymia has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment Child-Pugh score 10  Kidney Stones Use of Qsymia has been associated with kidney stone formation.</p>
<p>Topiramate, a component of Qsymia, inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity and promotes kidney stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and increasing urine pH. Avoid the use of Qsymia with other drugs that inhibit carbonic anhydrase e. Use of topiramate by patients on a ketogenic diet may also result in a physiological environment that increases the likelihood of kidney stone formation. Oligohidrosis And Hyperthermia Oligohidrosis decreased sweating , infrequently resulting in hospitalization, has been reported in association with the use of topiramate, a component of Qsymia.</p>
<p>Decreased sweating and an elevation in body temperature above normal characterized these cases. Some of the cases have been reported with topiramate after exposure to elevated environmental temperatures.</p>
<p>Patients treated with Qsymia should be advised to monitor for decreased sweating and increased body temperature during physical activity, especially in hot weather. Caution should be used when Qsymia is prescribed with other drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders; these drugs include, but are not limited to, other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic activity. Hypokalemia Qsymia can increase the risk of hypokalemia through its inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity.</p>
<p>In addition, when Qsymia is used in conjunction with non- potassium sparing diuretics such as furosemide loop diuretic or hydrochlorothiazide thiazide-like diuretic this may further potentiate potassium- wasting. Laboratory Tests Qsymia was associated with changes in several clinical laboratory analytes in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.</p>
<p>Advise patients of the following: Adjunctive Treatment Qsymia is indicated for chronic weight management in conjunction with a reduced- calorie diet and increased physical activity.</p>
<p>Access to Qsymia Qsymia is only available through certified pharmacies that are enrolled in the Qsymia certified pharmacy network. Advise patients on how to access Qsymia through certified pharmacies. Additional information may be obtained via the website www. Concomitant Use with Other Products Advise patients to tell healthcare provider s about all medications, nutritional supplements, and vitamins including any weight loss products that are being taken or may be taken while on Qsymia.</p>
<p>I am a 25 year old young, healthy female. Last year I had a nightmarish experience after getting pregnant from a misplaced IUD and eventually having a miscarriage which, at that time, I had absolutely no idea and thought it was my period, just heavier blood flow from the IUD. He kept my things hostage in his apartment in another City. I flew back home. Things were pretty nasty. By the time I got pregnant I was hitting close to lbs. I was riding horses a day plus working out religiously.</p>
<p>I was trying to eat as healthy as possible and I could not drop the pounds at all. I was exhausted and in disbelief by how hard it got to lose weight when my body had normally fluctuated a few pounds here and there. To the point I did consider lipo just to attack the stubborn areas, mostly inner thoughts and for the first time in my life, belly area. Finally a friend introduced me to Phentermine.</p></p>
