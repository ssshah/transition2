		<p><p>Waiting too long will make the weight more difficult to lose. Step 2 Adjust your diet. Reduce the typical amount of calories you're eating. Eat more low-calorie foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Increase the fiber in your diet by eating more whole grains and legumes. Save sweets for an occasional treat. Step 3 Eat carbohydrates by themselves to produce more serotonin. Eat about 30g of a sweet or starchy food such as breakfast cereal, pretzels, popcorn or rice. Don't combine carbohydrate with protein, which prevents serotonin production, or fat, which adds calories.</p>
<p>Step 4 Learn the difference between hunger and appetite. Antidepressants and Weight Gain: What Happens and Why Although there are a number of theories as to why antidepressants lead to weight gain, Sussman believes that both appetite and metabolism may be affected. Continued "I have had patients who swear that they are not eating any more, but still gaining weight, so that tells us there is some kind of metabolic influence going on; I have also had patients tell me that they are not only more hungry and eating more, but that the medicines are encouraging a carbohydrate craving that is hard to control, so we know appetite also plays a role," he says.</p>
<p>Fincham says antidepressants may also simply help us to rediscover pleasure in our life -- including food. So in this instance they may actually be overeating and not even realize they are doing so, says Fincham. Findings from a group of Italian researchers published in the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics suggest that the simple act of recovery from depression may play a role in the weight gain.</p>
<p>Weight Gain and Antidepressants: Switching Drugs Can Help While experts may not be certain about why antidepressants cause weight gain, they do know that switching drugs may make a difference. Some antidepressants may be less likely to affect weight. Effexor and Serzone generally do not cause weight gain, while Wellbutrin can cause weight loss. Sometimes switching within the same class of drugs can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>The downside to switching drugs: You may also find helpful information at: Does Zoloft make you gain weight? Zoloft sertraline is a type of antidepressant known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI.</p>
<p>It is commonly used to treat depression, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD , panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD.</p>
<p>The most common side effects with Zoloft include dry mouth, insomnia, sexual side effects, diarrhea, nausea, and sleepiness. Weight increase and appetite increase are also among the possible side effects. Does Zoloft cause weight gain if food consumption and exercise don't change? Changes in weight and appetite are common side effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs , the class of drugs that includes Zoloft sertraline.</p>
<p>Patients should contact their health care provider for any changes in their medical condition, including unusual weight gain. Do not stop or change the amount of medication you take without talking to your health care provider first. According to the literature available, Zoloft sertraline can cause changes in weight. If you have been experiencing unexplained changes in weight, with no changes in diet or activity level, you may want to contact your health care provider.</p>
<p>For more information on Zoloft sertraline or weight management you may want to visit our Web site at: Can I take vitamin B, omega 3, zinc, and vitamin D along with Zoloft and atenolol?</p>
<p>The supplements and medications you list vitamin B, omega 3, zinc, vitamin D, Zoloft, and atenolol appear to be safe when taken together. But if you start experiencing any symptoms out of the ordinary, you should check in with your doctor.</p>
<p>I was reading somewhere that Zoloft can lead to breast cancer. According to the prescribing information available, Zoloft sertraline has not been reported to cause breast cancer. If you are concerned about breast cancer risk you may want to contact your health care provider. For additional information regarding Zoloft you may want to visit our website. Will I notice a change in the effectiveness of Zoloft with a different generic? Generic drug products are evaluated by the FDA for bioequivalency, meaning they have similar blood levels as the brand name drug.</p>
<p>The FDA allows for very small variabilities in the performance of generic drugs. However, approval by the FDA indicates that the generic product is the same with respect to identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency, as the brand name drug.</p>
<p>The inactive ingredients are what can differ from product to product. This may contribute to differences in tolerability or side effects. Sarah Lewis, PharmD Q: I would like to stop taking Zoloft, which I've been taking for five years. How do I wean myself off of it gradually? My doctor agrees with the idea but said I must not stop abruptly. Side effects may occur when patients stop taking Zoloft sertraline or other drugs like it. These side effects include restlessness, irritability, agitation, dizziness, anxiety, confusion, headache, tiredness, and insomnia.</p>
<p>You should reduce your dose gradually, by small amounts. If intolerable side effects develop following a decrease in the dose or upon stopping treatment, then talk to your doctor and consider resuming the previously prescribed dose. After the side effects have subsided, the dose can be decreased at a more gradual rate.</p>
<p>I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been put on Zoloft. May I please ask exactly what it does? Zoloft sertraline is an SSRI, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Zoloft has been around since as the only alternative to Prozac fluoxetine in that class of medication. It effectively raises certain neurotransmitters at the postsynaptic cleft, so that your brain seems to have more serotonin a feel-good chemical , dopamine another feel-good chemical , and to a certain extent, norepinephrine important for motivation and focus.</p>
<p>This medication tries to stabilize your serotonin at a normal level so that you no longer bounce between mania and depression. At times, Zoloft will work by itself for this diagnosis; at other times, adjunct medication may need to be added. Feel free to visit us here: Matt Curley, PharmD Q: I take a generic version of Zoloft. Do you think that 25 mg could be causing me to gain weight?</p>
<p>Although people frequently gain weight while on antidepressants such as Zoloft sertraline , it's not clear why. There are a couple of reasons why it's difficult to say that antidepressants cause weight gain.</p>
<p>First, the studies of these medications usually last less than 12 weeks — not long enough to see significant weight changes. Second, since loss of appetite and weight loss are common symptoms of depression, it's possible that many cases of antidepressant-related weight gain are caused by the depression getting better, not by the medication itself.</p>
<p>The SNRIs tend to be a little more stimulating and cause appetite suppression, which may lead to people losing weight while on these medications. If the weight gain is substantial, you may want to have a discussion with your physician to see what other options are available to you. Lori Poulin, PharmD Q: Should someone take Xanax and Zoloft?</p>
<p>These medications are used together to help treat medical conditions. As long as your health care provider has prescribed you these medications, then he or she thinks this is the best course of treatment for you. Do not take these medications other than the way you have been instructed to, and if you develop any strange feelings, let your provider know. Gerald Levy, RPh Q: Is it okay to just stop taking Zoloft? According to the drug maker, abrupt discontinuation of Zoloft sertaline can result in severe withdrawal effects.</p>
<p>The symptoms can include irritability, agitation, dizziness, anxiety, confusion, headache, tiredness, and insomnia. Monitoring for symptoms should be done by a medical provider for anyone stopping medication. A gradual lowering of the dose is recommended to avoid these effects. Symptoms do decrease over time, but if intolerable restarting or increasing the dose should alleviate them. If you don't see a difference with Zoloft, should I stop taking it? I've been on it for 3 years.</p>
<p>The fact that you don't necessarily see a difference may be an indication that you may be underdosed, however, rest assured that there is an effect. There have been several misadventures by people who have stopped taking this medication cold turkey, and I do not recommend it. In , we had a patient who stopped taking their Zoloft suddenly and they were involved in a very serious car accident, the patient reported having feelings of disassociation and was eventually put back on the medication.</p>
<p>Please consult your prescriber regarding either increasing your dose or slowly tapering off of it. I currently take Zocor, Cozaar, Synthroid, Prempro, and a baby aspirin each day. My doctor wants me to add Zoloft. I'm concerned about this. Is it safe to take with the other medications? I have reviewed your question regarding Zocor simvastatin , Cozaar losartan , Synthroid levothroid , Prempro conguated estrogens , aspirin, and Zoloft sertraline.</p>
<p>The available literature indicates that is a slight increase in bleeding due to the interaction between the aspirin and Zoloft sertraline. You may want to review this with your physician. For any immediate concerns, consult your physician Thank you for contacting Everyday Health Q: My son is 16 and on Zoloft. Today he had an anxiety attack. He has been on the medication for about 12 weeks and was fine until today, although he did not began to show signs of improvement until about a week ago.</p>
<p>He also has a lot of issues with acne and has been on almost all antibiotics recommended for it. I heard that there is an effective medication, but that there are many side effects for it including depression. Zoloft sertraline is used to treat both depression and anxiety attacks. As with all antidepressant medications, it can take several weeks to show effectiveness. Side effects are patient-specific and often dose-related. The most common antibiotic used to treat acne is tetracycline.</p>
<p>All antibiotics also have side effects which are patient-specific. Please talk to your son's doctors about your concerns. I am currently on Zoloft, and, would appreciate any valid information you can give me on it. Zoloft sertraline is very effective drug often used to treat depression. It is a member of a class of drugs called SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p>
<p>The following website discusses many aspects of the drug: How long should a patient stay on Zoloft? Does it cause additional difficult episodes if ones stays on it a long period of time?</p>
<p>Zoloft sertraline is an antidepressant medication in the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRI. When antidepressants are used to treat depression it is generally recommended to be on the medication for one year and then taper off. If a patient continues to have episodes of depression, or the first episode was very severe a patient may be on it indefinitely. Many patients will be on Zoloft sertraline or other antidepressants for many many years without complications.</p>
<p>Your health care provider can provide you with more information about how long your antidepressant treatment will be for. I am currently partially breastfeeding my daughter who turns 5 months next week. She gets about half her intake from formula, and the other half from breastmilk both nursing and expressed milk. I need to go on Zoloft in order to help with my premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMDD and am willing to go on a reduced breastfeeding schedule, in order to minimize the risk of transferring the medicine to my baby.</p>
<p>Would you be able to help me figure out the optimum time gap between taking the medication 50 mg once a day , and nursing my baby? Studies have shown that levels of Zoloft sertraline and its metabolite found in the breast milk of mothers is very low. There are no published controlled studies on the use of Zoloft by breastfeeding women.</p>
<p>Based on the way Zoloft is distributed within the body, it would be difficult to impossible to determine any optimal time between taking the medication and nursing. Therefore, basically all times would be equal in exposure to any drug levels in the mother. I took half a Zoloft today as recommended, and I felt more anxious and like I was going to jump out of my skin. I had not eaten, and I took it with my baby aspirin and high blood pressure pill.</p>
<p>Is that a side effect or what? The empty stomach and other medications should not have caused the effect you had. Sometimes people respond this way to one medication in this family, but not to others. If you have only taken one dose, your doctor may want you to try it again, to see if you get the same response or if your body gets adjusted to it. If it happens again, let your doctor know that you are not tolerating it and another SSRI can be tried. These medications do take approximately one month to get the full effects from, but you should have more energy and motivation to do things after the first few days.</p>
<p>After you are on one antidepressant for about a month, do not stop it abruptly, as this can cause anxiety and more depression. A taper down is recommended after being on an antidepressant for a month. Let your doctor know what happened and see what he or she wants to do.</p>
<p>For more information on medications and depression, please visit our links at: I've been taking Zoloft for three years, but not noticing a difference in how I feel. Can I stop taking it? The first thing I notice is that you have been on it for three years. There is a chance that the medication may be helping you, but you don't realize it. Sometimes patients stop their antidepressants, and then they realize that it was actually helping them. However, if you have the perception that it is not working, then you may need to consider a different dosage of Zoloft sertraline or a different antidepressant.</p>
<p>One very important thing about Zoloft setraline is that it should not be abruptly stopped and no medication should be stopped without permission from your health care provider. Please talk with your health care provider regarding your options in treatment. Attached is a link to additional information provided by Everyday Health regarding depression. I started taking Zoloft 50mg once a day, after taking it, I get very nauseous.</p>
<p>Should I cut the pill in half and take it after breakfast and lunch, instead of taking 1 pill on an empty stomach? Zoloft sertraline can be taken with or without food. Taking Zoloft with a full meal may help to reduce some of the nausea.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work for you, it would be best to speak with the doctor prior to taking the medication in two halves. If this is a new medication for you, often times the side effects will lessen and may even go away completely as your body gets more accustomed to the medication. If the nausea continues to be a problem, the doctor may even consider changing your medication. Normally it is best to speak with your doctor regarding any type of changes to your medication regimen.</p>
<p>Megan Uehara, PharmD Q: What exactly will drinking alcohol and taking Zoloft do? Zoloft sertraline is an antidepressant classified as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI. Zoloft sertraline works on chemicals in the brain to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD , panic disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD and premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMDD. It may also be used to treat other conditions as determined by your health care provider.</p>
<p>Some of the most commonly reported side effects associated with Zoloft sertraline therapy include drowsiness, dizziness, feeling tired, nausea, upset stomach, constipation, dry mouth, changes in weight or appetite, difficulty sleeping and decreased sex drive or difficulty having an orgasm. This is not a complete list of possible side effects so it is important to consult your health care provider if you experience anything unusual or bothersome.</p>
<p>According to the prescribing information, patients being treated with Zoloft sertraline should avoid alcohol. Although studies did not show an increase in mental or motor skill impairment with alcohol, patients taking Zoloft sertraline are still advised to avoid alcohol.

<p>Beth Isaac, PharmD Q: How should Zoloft be dosed in a teenager? Zoloft Sertraline is an antidepressant in a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs. Sertraline affects a chemical in the brain that can become unbalanced and cause depression, panic, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
