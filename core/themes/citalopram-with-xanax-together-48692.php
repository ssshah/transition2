		<p><p>I was beyond devastated. Now, 6 months later, I have been through hell, I've seen 3 therapists and a psychiatrist and my GP. I switched to Celexa in nov or dec, 20mg. End of January of this year, dose was doubled to 40mg. Read More Do you think you really need to take xanax or klonopin? Do you get alot of exercise? I find that when I work out and get alot of exercise daily, I fall asleep alot better.</p>
<p>Read More I am a chronic patient of panic attacks, palpitation and anxiety and tried each of the above-mentioned medications, such as Librium, Valium, Ativan and Xanax. I found Ativan and Xanax more effetive and suitable. My physician has advised to add up Buspar, 5 MG combined with Xanax 0.</p>
<p>Read More When I am not taking my meds, I am tired, can sleep all day, am completely unmotivated to do anything and do not want to socialize with anyone. I have tried several different meds and am currently taking Celexa and Adderall XR. My psy says that adding the Adderall will "kick in the Celexa" and make it work better. I'm new here, and the forum for asking the doctor has reached it's limit of questions for the day, so I came here. I had no problem with that switch over. Ativan is definitely my drug of choice, but I just couldn't afford it.</p>
<p>I want my life back. To say the last 5 years of my life was "Hell on earth" woudl be the understatement of the century. Along with the Xanax, for the 5 years, my doctor had me taking 80mgs daily of a drug called Protonix which is a PPI Read More I've been taking Xanax for approx 30 years for anxiety.</p>
<p>My average dose was 1 per day unless I had a panic attack or dizziness. I did notice a few years ago that the government was limiting how many refills doctors could give. I started out with a years worth of refills then it went to six months and I had to call. Then 3 months and a call. Read More I have tried to switch over to ativan, serax, and xanax and just dump the valium all together to give the other ones a go but I can't do it because the valium withdrawals start kicking in.</p>
<p>The only drug I have been able to completely switch back over is klonopin where I did a valium taper and added klonopin over a period of a few weeks and I didn't notice any withdrawals from valium doing that. Read More They are very effective for anxiety as well as depression.</p>
<p>Benzo's like xanax and klonopin may help anxiety short term but aren't effective for depression alone and may in fact make it worse. My finger joints feel sore. I can't hold a book or magazine and turn the pages, my hands and fingers feel sore. Read More an increase of adrenaline and decrease of dopamine - and this feeling of depersonalistion and derealisation is a result. You are not going insane and this will rebalance itself. Read More I take citalopram 2mg everyday and I have not been able to afford my prescription this last week - and all this has started.</p>
<p>I will get my prescription this weekend and hope that this sensation stops. It is scary and disconcerting, my heart can beat fast and loud, my eyes unfocus, I see things that aren't there, my eyes feel strange and of curse my brain.</p>
<p>As if someone is switching me off for a second. Part of me thinks that one time it will switch off for good but I just want it to stop! Read More Hi, I'm a 27 year old girl. A year ago I took Citalopram hexal, Xanax , and Nortriptyline for my depression and long term and crippling left sided headaches which wouldn't go away even with the strongest pain killers.</p>
<p>About four days after taking the pills,I experienced a terrible shock. Suddenly my whole body went ice-cold especially the top of my head ,together with strong heart beats and vision impairment. It was like I was dying.</p>
<p>Since then my headaches disappeared. Read More Please respond to this post by naming those meds and drugs. Medhelp will then put together the information about them -which will appear under the Health Pages section in its own database, just for this community. Thanks, everyone, for your usual good attention. Read More The only side effects were dry mouth and weight loss not a negative.</p>
<p>About 5 months ago my doctor put me on citalopram which made me feel like a zombie and I started gaining weight so we decided to switch to the wellbutrin.</p>
<p>I have been on the wellbutrin for about 7 weeks now and off the citalopram for a little over 1 week. Im having a completely different experience than I did before. Read More i have been taking benzodiazipines for 13 years. These include xanax , and lexotanil. I was detoxed from xanax over a period of a month with heavy detox medications but it was still hell.</p>
<p>This was almost two years ago. But after withdrawal, I was given lexotanil. I began to use more and more as my tolerance built up until it was mgs a dayending on my anxiety levels. Then I had a panic attack in the park and took about  Since then, my meds were taken away from me.</p>
<p>Read More Again, these are things that are SO unlike me it is ridiculous,but I have heard worse stories from people blacking out on Xanax , and it scares me to my very soul. I could be worried about nothing,but at the end of the day I'll probably never find out what happened during that blackout,and I need help trying to cope with the guilt and learning how I can come to accept the fact that there will always be this unknown. My doc just prescribed me Citalopram, good idea?</p>
<p>Read More I have gone through a deep depression, using Citalopram and the above mentioned things. If I feel a turn towards depressive thoughts, I have often changed this by going to the beach and gone through a set of Qi Gong - it is strong, believe me.</p></p>
