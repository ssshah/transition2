        </div>
	 
		<p><p>My doctor told me it works much like a reuptake inhibitor. She tried me on Lexipro for a bit but I never felt like myself when I was taking it.. To all my addict friends, I highly recommend this drug. It keeps the monkey on my back satisfied by taking just one a day. I actually feel happy most of the time. As to getting off of it, is it any worse than getting off Lexipro. I hated that drug. Drama-dol helps me with binge eating, too. No addiction associated with it that I could find.</p>
<p>I take one in the morning and one around 2 PM. Have used a walker, can, crawled, etc. With this miracle drug I am alive and on my feet.</p>
<p>I am never free of pain, but, I am just about as free as I am ever going to get. This is not a narcotic. It works like Codeine they say. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. I have had it for about 25 years. Everything has a side effect. With Tramadol, I have found no side effects. Some constipation for which I use one little stool softener a day. It is definitely my cup of tea. I am afraid that I might be addicted to it in the future. Day time still coughing and I am tired.</p>
<p>What do you suggest since I am afraid from this addiction after I read for almost 2 hours about this medicine.</p>
<p>Your help is appreciated. You may develop physical dependence on tramadol after daily use for more than a week, or so… but this is not addiction. Have you looked into other anti-tussives? The only thing with narcotics alone are withdrawl if a stupid docor takes you off of them and constip[ation which i cured with 2 bowls of granola a day and you need more as time goes by1 so to all the doctor shoppers and pill pigs the best thing for you is to od!</p>
<p>I am 59 and have worked my tail off for 40 years and played music that long and am tired of being treated loke a kid or drug addict! Or you will go threw needless pain1 ive been around aa for 41 years and studued it for 30 plus!</p>
<p>Peace Love hope and May the power of Guide and bless you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just wanted to give you an update that I recently received. DEA has recently determined that tramadol will soon become a federal controlled substance, similar to other pain medications. Thank you, Kimberly and Mike. It felt like the times I had been given morphine or codine in the hospital. I wonder if I took Zofran before taking Ultram if I would be alright.</p>
<p>It gave me no side affects and virtually took my cough away. Sometimes by the way I would get into a coughing spell that would seal off my air and I could not breathe. Do to having to refill all the time, He finally changed my prescription  I took as needed but never became addicted to it. My Doctor just retired last year. I finally got a new Doctor this year whom I lick very much.</p>
<p>I told him if that was the case I would stop taking it and look for some other way to control my cough. So far I have not been able to do so. I am going to have to ask him to give it back to me.</p>
<p>Have a great day, Kent john 5: Ivana Addiction Blog  And take 50mg of tramadol for teeth pain. Can it harm my baby? Should I stop taking it? Ivana Addiction Blog 2: Does the prescribing doctor know that you are expecting? I suggest you should seek advise from your gynaecologist to determine whether you can keep taking it or should avoid using completely. I am highly allergy to any form of codeine and have suffered the same effects as any other codeine product.</p>
<p>My effects are utter depression with suicidal thoughts while on this drug. Off of this drug and any type of codeine, synthetic or natural, I am completely up beat without any depression. I never thought of the medication as an opiate because I never had the side effects typical of Codeine containing products. The feeling was… indescribable. He was an okada rider and other drug users would ask him to go and buy the drugs for them.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was taking everything including alcohol. The neighbourhood is a typically northern setting where small markets and shops lie adjacent to houses. It is a surprising find in a community like this one.</p>
<p>Nigeria Health Watch We enter a classroom decorated with alphabets and numbers on the wall where a group of about 20 young men are seated. FOMWAN Kano took it as a responsibility 11 years ago to fight the scourge of drug abuse in its communities, but wanted to do it without the traditional naming and shaming approach.</p>
<p>We started bringing food to them, we bought mats for them and gradually they got comfortable with us. That was how we started talking to them about their lifestyles. Whenever I went home I would go straight to bed. Later I reduced to taking only a bottle of Codeine instead of two in the morning.</p>
<p>Eventually he was diluting just a cover of codeine with some coke, until he gave up on codeine and tramadol completely. The youth association, Jajircewa, currently includes 53 young people who are recovering from drug abuse.</p>
<p>I am definately addicted. I can not get more for two weeks and think its time to stop, but am terrified of what tomorrow has in store for me. Cant sleep as of right now. Does anyboday have some advice on what to do first? Read More I have been taking about 6 Fioricet with codeine per day for seven years!!!!!! The last two years I have tried many times to taper on my own and just did not have the strengh to do it. Anyway, I have been tapered in a matter of only four weeks, which personally, I think has been too quick.</p>
<p>I have no more pills, but the doc has given me Klonopin, Nueronton and Vistoral, which I have been gradually upping the dose as I have tapered, per his instructions.</p></p>
