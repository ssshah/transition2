		<p><p>The pain was characterized by pricking, tingling, numbness, and sometimes electric shocks. The average pain score, 8 on the point numerical rating scale NRS , was reduced to 6 after the usage of oral pregabalin mg daily. On previously prescribed oral amitriptyline 40 mg daily she experienced intolerable adverse events, such as continuous drowsiness and tiredness. Her other complaints, such as urine retention, constipation, and spasms were successfully treated with solifenacin, polyethylene glycol, and baclofen, respectively.</p>
<p>In May , while on pregabalin treatment, the patient developed a severe burning pain in her left foot, scoring 9 on NRS. The patient also experienced electric shocks and could not bear the contact with bed sheets allodynia. Thirty minutes after application the patient did not experience allodynia anymore.</p>
<p>However, when the initial pain score was higher than 5 on NRS, the burning pain was only partially reduced. The relief lasted the entire day. In order to determine whether pain alleviation was due to topical or to systemic effect, we suggested distant application. After application to the nonpainful foot, analgesia could also be observed in the painful foot, although 15 minutes later.</p>
<p>Due to her physical impairments the patient was not able to apply the topical amitriptyline to her painful foot. Therefore, we advised her to apply topical amitriptyline cream to her inner forearms, which turned out to have the same effect as direct application to the nonpainful foot. The compounding pharmacist blinded the two creams in two separate tubes, and named the creams A and B, respectively. Successful treatment was defined based on the following criteria: The result was that the pain disappeared after application of cream B, while most of the time cream A did not reduce the pain.</p>
<p>She did not need to use the escape medication in the week of using the active cream, though she used frequently escape medication in the placebo weeks, especially when the pain scores were above 4 on NRS. Furthermore, the patient did not experience any adverse events.</p>
<p>Discussion To our knowledge this is the first report of treating central neuropathic pain due to MS with topical amitriptyline cream. This double blind placebo controlled n-of-1 experiment demonstrates that most of the pain reduction could be attributed to the active compound. The fact that the burning pain disappeared after distant application suggests a systemic effect.</p>
<p>Despite that pregabalin mg daily reduced the pricking and tingling pain, severe burning pain with allodynia developed. In contrast, a complete reduction of this burning neuropathic pain with allodynia was achieved after adding topical amitriptyline.</p>
<p>This observation might suggest that distinct characteristics of the central neuropathic pain respond differently to different types of analgesics, supported by sparse research [ 8 , 9 ].</p>
<p>As such, physicians have been in search of additional treatment modalities for this particularly troubling pain syndrome. Several published studies on IV infusion for the treatment of Fibromyalgia have reported good results. In a study by Graven-Neilsen et al, patients with Fibromylagia were given IV Ketamine infusions on an outpatient basis. The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind crossover study involving 29 patients.</p>
<p>The authors reported a decrease in pain at rest, local and referred pain areas, the span between the pain threshold to single and repeated intramuscular stimuli, and increased the pain pressure pain intolerance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for some, this regimen does not provide optimal relief. IV infusions of Ketamine have been shown to provide significant relief and offer a degree of comfort for those suffering from this terrible disease. In , Mercadante et al published a paper on the use of IV Ketamine on patients with cancer reporting uncontrolled pain despite the usage of morphine.</p>
<p>In those given IV Ketamine, there was a significant decrease in reported pain. As time passes and wounds heal, the need for such treatments will decrease. In some cases, the pain will persist well beyond the expected need for these medications. Anecdotally, many institutions have reported overwhelming successes in these cases with the addition of IV Ketamine — particularly after orthopedic procedures such as joint replacements or reconstructions.</p>
<p>Lidocaine, on the other hand, has a well-documented history of decreasing the need for opiate in the post-surgical setting and has been shown to improve the course of recovery.</p>

A double-blind placebo controlled study. The pain was characterized by pricking, tingling, numbness, and sometimes electric shocks. In a study by Williams and Stark, 71 patients presenting with chronic daily headaches were treated with IV Lidocaine. Unfortunately, the use of these drugs is often limited due lidocaine adverse events. Successful treatment was defined based on the following criteria: There are several studies on PHN that was refractory to conventional treatment but subsequently responsive lidocaine IV infusions of Lidocaine[9] or Ketamine.
