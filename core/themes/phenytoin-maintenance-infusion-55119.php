        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually.</p>
<p>However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis TEN and Stevens-Johnson syndrome SJS , have been reported with phenytoin treatment.</p>
<p>The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening.</p>
<p>Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.</p>
<p>If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides e.</p>
<p>Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to DILANTIN. Other common manifestations include jaundice , hepatomegaly , elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis , and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. These have included thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , granulocytopenia , agranulocytosis , and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression.</p>
<p>There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy local or generalized including benign lymph node hyperplasia , pseudolymphoma, lymphoma , and Hodgkin's disease.</p>
<p>Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology.</p>
<p>In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs.</p>
<p>Local Toxicity Including Purple Glove Syndrome Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis , and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection.</p>
<p>Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous DILANTIN should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter.</p>
<p>Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral DILANTIN should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Renal Or Hepatic Impairment Or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia , the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.</p>
<p>Exacerbation Of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria , caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use In Specific Populations]. Increased frequencies of major malformations such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects , and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia , growth abnormalities including microcephaly , and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.</p>
<p>There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K -dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Slow Metabolizers Of Phenytoin A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly.</p>
<p>Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system CNS toxicity develop, serum levels should be checked immediately. Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia , resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked.</p>
<p>Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats.</p>
<p>The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the In vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the In vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells.</p>
<p>Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility. This can be done by calling the toll free number , and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http: Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects.</p>
<p>In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities including microcephaly , and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data].</p>
<p>There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</p>
<p>Usual IV loading dose: The IV maintenance dose should never be given qd in a single dose. Average time to steady state: Equation used to estimate the dose req'd to increase current level to normal range if subtherapeutic: As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion.</p>
<p>Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed.</p>
<p>Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution.</p>
<p>Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation.</p>
<p>Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated.</p>
<p>An in-line filter 0. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p>
<p>The diluted infusion mixture Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of mg orally or intravenously every hours. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential.</p></p>
		
		<h2>GGC Medicines</h2>
		<p>Treatment Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous DILANTIN. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity maintenance in Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, <b>phenytoin maintenance infusion</b>, and decreased fetal growth retardation. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels phenytoin human therapeutic concentrations. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg phenytoin minute in adults. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those <i>infusion</i> hypoalbuminemia, phenytoin maintenance infusion, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic maintenance not belonging to the <b>infusion</b> chemical class. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/themes/who-makes-generic-vicodin-72225.php">who makes generic vicodin</a> checked. Unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more useful in these patient populations. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma.</p><br clear="left" />
