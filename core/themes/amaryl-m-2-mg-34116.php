            <h1>Amaryl m 2 mg - Amaryl Dosage and Administration</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>While the tmax, clearance, and volume of distribution of glimepiride in the morbidly obese patients were similar to those in the normal weight group, the morbidly obese had lower Cmax and AUC than those of normal body weight. In a randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or aspirin 1 gram three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days.</p>
<p>On Day 4 of each study period, a single 1 mg dose of Amaryl was administered. The Amaryl doses were separated by a day washout period. In a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study, healthy subjects received either a single 4 mg dose of Amaryl alone, Amaryl with ranitidine mg twice daily for 4 days; Amaryl was administered on Day 3 , or Amaryl with cimetidine mg daily for 4 days; Amaryl was administered on Day 3.</p>
<p>Co-administration of cimetidine or ranitidine with a single 4 mg oral dose of Amaryl did not significantly alter the absorption and disposition of glimepiride. In a randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or propranolol 40 mg three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 or each study period, a single 2 mg dose of Amaryl was administered.</p>
<p>The recovery of M1 and M2 from urine was not changed. In an open-label, two-way, crossover study, healthy subjects received 4 mg of Amaryl daily for 10 days.</p>
<p>Single 25 mg doses of warfarin were administered 6 days before starting Amaryl and on Day 4 of Amaryl administration. The concomitant administration of Amaryl did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin enantiomers.</p>
<p>No changes were observed in warfarin plasma protein binding. Amaryl resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the pharmacodynamic response to warfarin.</p>
<p>Sugar sources include orange juice, glucose gel, candy, or milk. If you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink, use an injection of glucagon. Your doctor can give you a prescription for a glucagon emergency injection kit and tell you how to give the injection. Your dose needs may change if you are ill, if you have a fever or infection, or if you have surgery or a medical emergency.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor how to adjust your glimepiride dose if needed. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Glimepiride is substantially excreted by the kidney. Elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment. A multiple-dose titration study was conducted in 16 patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 mg to 8 mg daily for 3 months.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of AMARYL were evaluated in the multiple-dose titration study and the results were consistent with those observed in patients enrolled in a single-dose study. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can be treated with oral glucose. Severe hypoglycemic reactions constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment.</p>
<p>Severe hypoglycemia with coma, seizure , or neurological impairment can be treated with glucagon or intravenous glucose. Glimepiride lowers the blood glucose levels by increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas. Metformin works by lowering the glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>This combination is not indicated for the treatment of Type 1 DM. What are the possible side effects of Amaryl m? The use of Amaryl m is associated with common side effects like hypoglycemia low blood sugar level , altered taste, nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, headache and upper respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>Its use can also lead to serious, but rare side effect lactic acidosis. On long term use it can also lead to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Therefore, in the event of one of these side effects, tell your doctor immediately. Reporting of side effects If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>
<p>This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the Yellow Card Scheme at: By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. How to store Amaryl Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Amaryl 1mg, 2mg, 3mg and 4mg tablets: Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture.</p>

These results only indicate the perceptions of the website users. In both studies, the relative total clearance of Amaryl increased when kidney function was impaired.

Your doctor can give you a prescription for a glucagon emergency injection kit and tell you how to give the injection. M1 is further metabolized to M2 by one or several cytosolic enzymes.

Clearance of glimepiride after oral administration does not change over the 1 mg to 8 mg dose range, indicating linear pharmacokinetics. If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Although, glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.
