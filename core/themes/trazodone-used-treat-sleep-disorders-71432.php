		<p><p>Trazodone was primarily created to treat depression. Off-label means the drug is not purposely manufactured for those purposes, is not FDA approved for the use, but is commonly used regardless for its proven effectiveness. How Trazodone Works The mechanism of anti-depressants like trazodone are different than that of straight forward sleep medications. The compounds in trazodone stimulate serotonin in the brain, yet another part of the complex neurological process.</p>
<p>But it should be noted that trazodone is not a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI. The latter two are both targets of popular sleep medications and hypnotics. Serotonin provides mood stability and when in small supply creates depression symptoms including mood disorders and the symptoms associated with insomnia.</p>
<p>With trazodone and insomnia, it should be administered at lower doses than it would be to treat depression, for the most effectiveness. Lower doses of trazodone affect certain receptors in the brain that help induce sleep, while higher doses could have the opposite effect. Ambien Ambien is a very popular brand name, prescription sleep aid, and people frequently wonder which is more effective when comparing trazodone vs. For the most part, a lot of people prefer trazodone over Ambien, because Ambien tends to have more side effects including sleepwalking.</p>

Ambien for your individual needs and determine which will be best.

Trazodone for insomnia tends to be effective for many people, and it has a lower risk profile than a lot of other sleep aids.</p>
<p>Trazodone for insomnia is usually prescribed at a lower dose than what a physician would prescribe for depression, and it can also work well as a drug to treat a combination of insomnia and depression in some patients. Trazodone was first approved as an antidepressant by the Food and Drug Administration in  More on Sleep The Problem With Sleeping Pills A handful of studies have shown that trazodone may improve sleep during the first two weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>But the drug has not been studied for longer than six weeks, so little is known about how well it works or how safe it is past that point for the treatment of chronic insomnia. Also, an effective dose range has never been established for insomnia, although lower doses are typically used.</p>
<p>But recent prescribing data suggest that doctors remain convinced that trazodone is an appropriate sleep medication for many people, even those without depression. The result is that doctors can prescribe trazodone without a limit on how many pills a patient can receive.</p>
<p>But there are no studies that confirm this. It can also cause abnormally low blood pressure and, in turn, dizziness or even fainting, particularly in seniors. And some evidence suggests that it can cause priapism, or persistent erection, a medical emergency that may require surgery and can lead to impotence if not treated promptly. See below for a full list. An earlier CR report found that drugs like diphenhydramine can cause dependence when taken for longer than directed usually two weeks.</p>
<p>If your insomnia lasts longer than a few nights, see your doctor to determine whether other factors, such as pain, heartburn, hot flashes, or drug side effects, could be disturbing your sleep.</p></p>
