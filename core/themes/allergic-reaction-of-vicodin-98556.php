            <h1>Apr 01,  · My allergy to Hydrocodone is life threatening allergies I think that it's very unlikely that this was an allergic reaction, in particular if there was.</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>What is the treatment for an allergic reaction to betadine? If the reaction to the betadine is consistent with contact dermatitis hives, redness, some swelling, itch , the treatment of choice would be a steroid injection and possibly a steroid cream.</p>
<p>Of course an emergent anaphalactic reaction to betadine would be epinephrine.. Of course an emergent anaphalactic reaction to betadine would be epinephrine. If you are allergic to codeine would you be allergic to Vicodin? The first thing that you need to know is if it is a true allergy orsimply a strong manifestation of the common opioid side effects. Ifyou do have a true allergy to codeine, you could be allergic tosome or all of the semi-synthetic preparations or you could be finewith them.</p>
<p>The semi-synthetic codeines include hydrocodone,oxycodone, and any other -codone named medications. You should also be aware that drug allergies can begin at any time. While you may have taken hydrocodone without incident for years,you may find yourself having a life-threatening reaction to it atany time. Once you have a reaction to codeine or a syntheticpreparation, you are at an increased risk of reacting to the otherpreparations. It would be wise to keep epinepherine anddiphenhydramine available if you are going to test the waters withany others.</p>
<p>If you find yourself allergic to codeine or the semi-syntheticpreparations, you may want to talk to your doctor about prescribinga medication from the morphine group as allergies to codeine andmorphine are generally unrelated. Is a vasovagal reaction the result of an allergic reaction? Allergic reactions are not typically a trigger for a vasovagalnerve reaction.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of known triggers, aswell as some unknown. Any type of nerve malfunction, stress, orpain can trigger a reaction, so the symptoms associated with anallergic reactions should not be ruled out entirely. If you are allergic to vicodine can you take norco? What are the signs of an food allergic reaction? There are many different signs that someone is having an allergic reaction to a certain food.</p>
<p>All people who ingest the food in which they are allergic to will have an allergic reaction, but some people may react to the allergen by touching it, or even smelling it. These are signs of an allergic reaction to a food: Tingling of the lips, and tongue Itchiness in the mouth, throat, or area of the body in which the allergen made contact with Swelling of the lips and tongue An Itchy Rash- The rash could be small or big, there can be patches of rashes all over the body, the rash could be bumpy the bumps are called hives Nausousness-The person may have an upset stomach, cramping, bloating, gas, and diarrhea WARNING: In a severe allergic reaction, The throat will swell, causing the airway to the lungs to be blocked, and the person will not be able to breathe.</p>
<p>Be sure to call immediately and if the person has an Epipen, inject it into their thigh. Can you have an allergic reaction to cactus quills? Yes, you can have an allergic reaction to anything.</p>
<p>You can even develop an allergy to things that you have previously never been allergic to before. If you think you are having an alleric reaction, take Benadryl if the reaction is not too severe. But if you begin having difficulty breathing, severe swelling, numbness, difficulty swallowing, etc If it is a serious allergic reaction, you can go into anaphalactic shock, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>What are signs of an allergic reaction? Hives, or rash, throat swelling, difficulty talking or breathing How do you recognize an allergic reaction? Allergies are the result of your body "fighting off" what it mistakenly believes are harmful chemicals. In a normal result, your antibody cells destroy viruses and bacteria which invade your body and could harm you.. In an allergic reaction, a harmless substance - usually something you eat or something you touch - sets off the same reaction from your antibodies.</p>
<p>This causes an easily-recognized set of symptoms in pretty-much everybody. I have put them in order based on how dangerous they can be.. Sneezing and watering eyes. Itching either all over the body or just on the area contacted. Redness and a bumpy rash hives or wheals are what you call the bumps.</p>
<p>Swelling of the throat and mouth. Each allergic reaction may produce one or more symptoms. Some people sneeze and itch whenever they get near an animal. Some people are fine with animals, but get an itchy rash if they eat strawberries.. The first three symptoms can easily be treated with over-the-counter allergy medication like diphenhydramine Benadryl is one brand name for this - these kinds of allergies are seldom dangerous, and usually disappear once you take the medicine..</p>
<p>If you should have ANY trouble with wheezing, feeling as if your throat is closing up, or swelling in the mouth area - go to the nearest emergency room and tell them you are having an allergic reaction with these symptoms. These are symptoms of a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis an-uh-fil-AX-iss.. Anaphylasis must be treated by a doctor as soon as possible, because it can cause you to stop breathing and die.</p>
<p>This is the reaction that you hear about most commonly in people who are allergic to beestings. The bee venom is actually injected into the body instead of being contacted like the less severe allergies, so it can cause death within minutes! Some people get anaphylaxis after eating certain foods.. The best way to treat any allergy is to take diphenhydramine as soon as you notice any discomfort. However, if you have the severe kind of reaction, don't waste time finding a drug store - go straight to the E.</p>
<p>What causes allergic reactions? Allergies are a hypersensitivity disorder of the immune system. Hypersensitivity reactions require a pre-sensitized immune condition of the host. Basically, it is caused by the immune system attacking something that would normally be considered harmless. Can people have allergic reactions to ants?</p>
<p>From their bites, venom and acids, yes.. The Fire Ants in the American Southwest cause a reaction similar to a bee sting, which can be fatal to those that are allergic to them. I have an allergic reaction to sulfur why? An allergic reaction is an abnormal immune system response to things that are normally harmless to most people.</p>
<p>When one is allergic to something, the immune system incorrectly identifies this substance as harmful to one's body. Substances which cause allergic reactions, such as certain foods, medicines, plant pollen, or dust, are called allergens. In an attempt to protect the body, the immune system produces immunoglobulin E antibodies.</p>
<p>When the IgE antibodies make contact with the allergens, they attach onto it and release chemicals such as histamine into the bloodstream. The histamine causes such allergic reactions as a runny nose, tearing eyes, sore throat, diarrhea, skin rashes, or difficulty breathing and swelling. Can you have an allergic reaction to calcium carbonate? Yes - you can have an allergic reaction to calcium carbonate. It's derived from oyster shells. Stop taking calcium carbonate and seek emergency medical attention if you experience a rare allergic reaction difficulty breathing; closing of the throat; swelling of the lips, tongue, or face; or hives.</p>
<p>Other, less serious side effects may be more likely to occur. Continue to take calcium carbonate and notify your doctor if you experience nausea or vomiting; decreased appetite; constipation; dry mouth or increased thirst; or increased urination.. Some drugs will affect calcium carbonate - before taking it tell your doctor if you are taking digoxin, antacids containing calcium or aluminum; calcitriol or vitamin D supplements; a tetracycline antibiotic such as tetracycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, minocycline, or oxytetracycline all these have various brand names..</p>
<p>Drugs other than those listed here may also interact with calcium carbonate. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medicines, including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products.</p>
<p>Symptoms of allergic reaction? It depends on the allergy. Obviously peanut allergies are the most serious and then shellfish, and eggs are the next.</p>
<p>Do not increase your dose, take the medication more frequently, or take it for a longer time than prescribed. Properly stop the medication when so directed. Pain medications work best if they are used as the first signs of pain occur.</p>
<p>If you wait until the pain has worsened, the medication may not work as well. If you have ongoing pain such as due to cancer , your doctor may direct you to also take long-acting narcotic medications. In that case, this medication might be used for sudden breakthrough pain only as needed. Other non-narcotic pain relievers such as naproxen , ibuprofen may also be prescribed with this medication.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about using this product safely with other drugs.</p>
<p>This medication may cause withdrawal reactions, especially if it has been used regularly for a long time or in high doses. In such cases, withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, watering eyes, runny nose , nausea, sweating , muscle aches may occur if you suddenly stop using this medication. To prevent withdrawal reactions, your doctor may reduce your dose gradually. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details, and report any withdrawal reactions immediately.</p>
<p>When this medication is used for a long time, it may not work as well. Talk with your doctor if this medication stops working well. The welts look strange, I am not sure how to explain them.</p>
<p>Took pics for the Doc to see. I am pretty sure they will switch me to the Vicodin, and I think it is called Robaxin. Problem is, my back still hurts too much and the Vicodin just does not cut it. Anyone know of something else stronger that I can take for just a little while longer. I was up walking the first night, and do several hours a day now, but need something for pain and spasms at least once a day, maybe two if I do too much.</p>
<p>I am very active and want to heal, but this itching is driving me nuts and I can't sleep either. Any good questions to ask my Allergy Doc or the Nurse Practioner about the meds? Looking for some of that intelligent info, or just plain ol experience from this group.</p></p>
