		<p><p>I quit the Lipitor and the Dr. I get very little sleep they are so severe and I have to get up and walk around. Now all kinds of heart tests! These station in just my opinion cause a much issues as they solve. Getting desperate as well for answers. Read More I stopped the Crestor and I don't feel quite as tired.</p>
<p>Also I didn't attribute the muscle pain and back pain I was having to it. It has mostly stopped also. I do have leg cramps but they were worse on the Crestor. I am going to get some Magnesium that was suggested by someone else. I wonder if I am converting the t4 to t3 correctly.</p>
<p>If I post my last blood test that had the t3free test on it could you tell by that. The holistic MD that I went to did that test. Read More Fat-soluble statins like Lipitor and Zocor cause more damage than water soluble statins like Pravachol and Crestor.</p>
<p>Hence the latter should be tried at lower dose. Possibility of hypothyroidism and diabetes should be ruled out as the presence of either disease can complicate the muscle pain. The role of Co Q10 in lowering cholesterol is controversial and should not be tried without consulting your doctor. Please discuss these points with your treating physician. Read More The doctor says everything looks O. I have not purchased these medications and do not plan to do so.</p>
<p>I am not ready or willing to deal with possible side effects of these drugs and would like to try diet and exercise to bring the Cholesterol in line first. The calcium scan test rate was 2. I did some research and found Omega Q plus by dr Sinatra.</p>
<p>Read More If this started only after the administration of Prednisone, then it could have been prescribed to counter a possible side effect of prednisone causing higher stomach acid excretion. Crestor depletes CoQ10 , vital for energy production, which may affect the entire cardiovascular system among other systems and parts of the body A doctor friend of mine told me once that cholesterol lowering drugs statins are the cause of the "Couch Potato Syndrome" lol!</p>
<p>Read More I had all of the classic muscle pains listed in statin side effects documentation. My doctor said it was because of coQ10 and vitamin D deficiency from the statins. She recommended StatinHelp www. It has really helped with the muscle pains. Statin side effects are never really discussed by the doctors. Thus, ubiquinone supplementation appears to be the only way for older people, and certainly the ill, to obtain the major proportion of the 0.</p>
<p>Failure to supplement by the aged, ill or stressed, can have tragic consequences in the form of irreversible damage in the brain, other organs and mitochondria everywhere. The mechanism by which vitamin C lowers cholesterol was discovered circa  The inescapable conclusion is that vitamin C does what statins do - lowers cholesterol -- without side-effects.</p>
<p>If the statin drugs were patterned after Vitamin C, they lack many other benefits of the vitamin. For example, vitamin C promotes the production of coenzyme Q10 and lowers Lp a.</p>
<p>It is interesting that in addition to vitamin C, our bodies require many B vitamins to synthesize CoQ Voluminous research has found beneficial effects from ascorbic acid supplementation similar to the effects found from smaller dose CoQ10 supplementation. For example, in a recent study, hydro soluble CoQ10 supplementation was shown to lower circulating levels of Lp a.</p>
<p>We speculate that some of these similar effects may be due to increased endogenous CoQ10 synthesis induced by the ascorbic acid along with generally better all around nutrition. Every human body makes up to mg of CoQ10 daily; no human body can make vitamin C. As important as CoQ10 is for health, vitamin C is more important, perhaps an order of magnitude. That fact is that most mammals synthesize ten times more vitamin C than they do CoQ10, when adjusted for body weight.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances the daily amount of ascorbic acid produced by mammals lies between 3, mg and 15, mg, with an average of 5, mg, when adjusted for comparison to the weight of the average male human being. We conclude that everyone should supplement 3, mg to 6,mg vitamin C daily from birth, including during pregnancy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, healthy, well-nourished children will usually synthesize their own CoQ With the possible exception of athletes, persons taking vitamin C should not have to supplement CoQ10 until the fourth or fifth decade of life.</p>
<p>Athletes have a high requirement for CoQ10 and may benefit from supplementation earlier in life. In patients with heart failure this is more than a laboratory observation. It has a significant harmful effect which can be negated by oral CoQ10 supplementation. We found, chasing down many of the media stories suggesting benefit, that most stories are either hoaxes or highly speculative.</p>
<p>In the world of media hype, an estimated 0. Furthermore, it is difficult to formulate an overall theory that explains the reported benefits. According to statistician Eddie Vos, after millions of statin pills, in those studies that have summarized or released the data, there is no change in mortality curves - the graphs of the placebo and statin groups touch.</p>
<p>Massive drug use, few lives saved. The next European study claiming benefit in high-risk elderly, PROSPER, found 6 lives saved but 24 more cancer deaths, and more new cancers in each of 4 years in a group with 52 fewer smokers. From 10 years ago: HPS reportedly had four study groups, 1 a placebo group, 2 a placebo-plus-antioxidant-vitamins group, 3 a statin group and 4 a statin-plus-antioxidant-vitamins group.</p>
<p>However, the paper is written without even a summary of the supporting data, and these results could very well have been between the statins-plus-antioxidants group 4 against the placebo group 1. The authors carefully avoid this issue.</p>
<p>The HPS paper does not discuss the differences between the statins group 3 and statins-and-antioxidants group 4 versus placebo, an obvious point of interest. Instead, they published the second paper diverting attention from this issue. The refusal to publish and share the data indicates that there is something to hide.</p>
