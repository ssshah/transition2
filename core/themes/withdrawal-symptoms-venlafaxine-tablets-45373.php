		<p><p>Coping with Withdrawal Symptoms 1 Familiarize yourself with the symptoms. Symptoms of Effexor withdrawal may include dizziness, fatigue, agitation, anxiety, chills, nausea, headaches, irritability, twitches or shakes, hives, a clicking or buzzing sound in your head, sweating, feelings of unease, muscle pain, and insomnia.</p>
<p>These can range from mild to severe. You may experience all of these symptoms or only a few. If you are in the throes of a withdrawal from Effexor, there are a few simple ways that you can cope. First, you should drink a lot of water. The more quickly you can flush toxins from your system, the sooner you can begin to feel better.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing Effexor withdrawal, chances are you will not want to eat; however, allowing yourself to get too hungry is a drain on your immune system, and will not help you to bounce back. Instead, try to nibble on nutrient-dense food, like fruits, vegetables, or nuts. Alternatively, eat a handful or trail mix or a couple pieces of beef jerky when you feel up to it.</p>
<p>The best way to deal with an Effexor withdrawal is to sleep right through it. Do your best to clear your schedule and get as much sleep as you can.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot fall asleep, simply taking it easy and getting some rest will enable your body to heal. Drink water before and after doing any intense sweating. Try to relax and take long, soothing breaths. This will help move oxygen through your bloodstream, lowering your heart rate and stabilizing your blood pressure.</p>
<p>Deep breathing can reduce anxiety, panic, and even nausea. Even after only 5 days I have withdrawal symptoms that are pretty horrendous. To me, that just proves what a strong powerful drug this is. So I will go back to what I was doing: I sympathize with all of you who have been on this drug for years and struggling so much with tapering off.</p>
<p>You are very strong people and amazing at supporting one and other. Reply Link Helen June 25, , 2: It worked like magic. So I started to taper off.</p>
<p>Last week was my first week without any. Could this be from the Effexor cessation? I am 64 and have Ehlers-Danlos Type 3 and was put on these for depression. I spent 10 days, sleeping, falling over, and talking gibberish. My doctor also said it would get better and to double the dose. I decided not to follow that route, but 5 days after stopping I still feel frail. I did not realize and was never told just how powerful this drug is.</p>
<p>Reply Link Laurie June 3, , 9: Effexor was my third attempt at finding a medication that would help get my general anxiety under control. I was supposed to bump down a dose from 50mg to  Well, I forgot the last two. Being on a lower dose and for such a short time I am completely baffled at how severe the withdrawals are. They feel impossible to manage. The first symptom I noticed was numbness in my tongue and lips, which started about 2 days after my last dose.</p>
<p>Day 3 I started to experience lightheadedness with the numbness. Day 4 it began to make me so nervous and upset I took some Xanax in the morning and drank some alcohol in the evening, after the Xanax wore off.</p>
<p>It comes in waves but they tend to overlap. I literally can not differentiate for the first 30 minutes or so. I just took one of the lower  I hope it will take the edge off enough to get through the next day or two. This sucks a lot. Reply Link Tim June 11, , 4: I was on mg, so the taper was a month or so long. I also used CBD oil during the worst of the withdrawal, and the first several weeks of med free living. Instead, I want to use the tools I learned while on Effexor to turn towards discomfort, see it for what it is, make a choice regarding my response to the discomfort, and then let it go.</p>
<p>I also have a few very mild episodes of feeling like my tongue is slow and numb, and I get a mild headache a few times a week. At first the dizziness, fat tongue, feeling of living in a bubble, and anxiety were very bad. However, I could see the withdrawal symptoms fading, so I stuck it out. I started at  I took mg for 5 months and tapered off in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Today is day 2 with no Effexor. I had a very real and terrible dream last night, and woke up completely wet from sweating. From what I have been reading, these symptoms seems normal.</p>
<p>I see where some of you have been taking this for years or decades. I would rather take a pill daily than to feel that way again.</p>
<p>Is it wrong for me to feel that way? Thanks for the support in advance. Reply Link Catherine June 11, , 7: The withdrawals are most unpleasant. But like many others, you will get through this and feel better for getting this drug out of your system. Gradually tapered off and stopped last January. Was fine, great, till end of April beginning of May. Then, I started having insomnia, bad cases of anxiety mostly when falling asleep , heart shakes, fatigue, morbid thoughts etc.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have withdrawal symptoms after 4 months of stopping Effexor? Catherine June 2, , 7: But well worth persevering. Reply Link Ashley May 26, , 9: I have never felt this hopeless before and the part that is pissing me off the most, everyone is telling me it will pass! Including my NEW psychiatrist!!! And there ya go; I am pissed off all the time! Things I worked through years ago are flooding my every thought, soaking each brain cell with negativity.</p>
<p>I had a terrible thing happen; PTSD related is enough to disclose. I had to go to Rehab for heroin addiction. Came off of heroin, spent 11 days in withdrawal. I was foggy for a good 6 months; but with help, I was able to get my life back. For all those that are going to judge me for that and not hear another word because of that 1 mistake.</p>
<p>But I have also read some of the stories and it breaks my heart. Thank you for reading. Please post if you have more information. You may help someone needing it today. Thank you for all who posted. You have helped me today. Reply Link Jodi June 23, , 8: I feel just brutal all the time. Congrats on your sobriety. My p-doc put me on Lamictal found I was bipolar and said I could drop the Effexor.</p>
<p>I was taking mg per day. I did so with no withdrawal symptoms. I had been taking opioids for 12 years. The Gabapentin is a life saver. FDA is considering recommending it to eliminate habitual-drug withdrawal.</p>
<p>Reply Link Shannon August 7, ,  Thank you, thank you, thank you! I am now on day 17 I think, of going cold turkey. I had been on effexor for almost 5 years, mgs a day. I have pretty much lost everything, my husband, my children, next will be my job. My question to you is, has it gotten any better? I was once the strongest person you would have met. My children are begging for their mom to come back.</p>
<p>They are suffering from some terrible struggles in life and need me! But will the withdrawals ever get better? I really hope so. Please let me know if you are doing okay. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Out of all the comments on this site, I relate to you the most. God, I hope there is a way out of this nightmare for us all. Hoping to hear from you. Sincerely, Shannon Reply Link shane May 26, ,  It has been 48 hours since I have taken my last dose.</p>
<p>I have been experiencing mild headaches and body aches this morning. Is it safe to say that the medication is out of my system and I am going through acute withdrawal?</p>
<p>Reply Link Catherine June 2, , 7: You were not on a high dose and it was for only a short time. Reply Link Jen June 15, , 3: Mostly in the legs. I went from 75 to  I have to go see my doctor but this all seems too weird. Happened after the medication decrease. Was on Cipralex for five years prior to that. Was put on for depression due to another health issue with my bowels!! How long will this muscle pain last?</p>
<p>Reply Link May May 25, , 6: Effexor wreaked havoc on my life, career, and personal relationships. I came here to see how much longer these symptoms would persist and was given a little hope reading through the article and comments. Reply Link Samantha May 21, ,  I had been on mg of Effexor for at least 2 years and I am still taking mg Wellbutrin.</p>
<p>I took my last pill 5 days ago and I feel like crap. Muscle aches, headache, hot and cold flashes, feeling exhausted and bad dreams. Also an upset stomach and nauseous off and on. How long will this last? I refuse to go back on Effexor but not sure how long I can stand feeling like this! Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>My new normal is not quite as laid back, but less likely to be taken advantage of. My blood pressure returned to normal after discontinuation. I was having trouble sleeping, but 1 mg of Melatonin for a few nights helped. The dreams are becoming less intense. I started gaining weight because I seemed to be craving junk food more.</p>
<p>But, last week I started walking and swimming almost everyday and eating healthier. In any event, I would have to be doing much worse before I would be tempted to start taking this med again. This med pulled me out of a severe 8 month depression, and I will always be grateful for that.</p>
<p>After at least a dozen tries, I think I finally made it. This forum really inspired me to hang in there and also to know what to expect. A big thank you to everyone that has contributed!! Tui June 7, ,  Reply Link Catherine May 22, , 9: From memory the first week was the worst. It got easier from then on. If you were on mg for that long, it should take you at least 8 to 12 months. Effexor is a very dirty drug. Notice how the maker is rushing to supply a kit for people that have decided to quit.</p>
<p>I bet they would make a fortune. Reply Link Geraldine July 7, , 6: Was not depressed for some years but kept taking them due to the difficulty getting off. I started tapering off 75 mg nearly a year ago by taking  Then 75 one day and  Just to get this far without withdrawal symptoms took months.</p>
<p>The doctor and pharmacist both recommended not decreasing any further until spring. Getting some sleepiness but not many other symptoms.</p>
<p>I think the really slow tapering is the way to go. Reply Link Pat May 16, , 5: The worst for me is my body just aches and brain zaps. Some days I can barely move, but I do. You have to find what works for you. Here are some suggestions that have helped me, no matter how much I hurt, I go exercise, I go to my book club, I take to the Universe God , I eat very healthy, I try to feel the feelings and let them pass. I send my good thoughts out to you all… It is so awesome that you are doing this… YOU will benefit… Hang in there.</p>
<p>Reply Link Marissa May 28, , 5: Goes to show how motivated and committed you are. And this mentality can be applied to daily life. I am 26 and was prescribed mg which is nothing compared to your dose.</p>
<p>And when he dropped me to 75 I felt all the symptoms above my body is very sensitive but your the prime example it can be done. And if we fall we must fall on our backs because if you can look up you can get up.</p>
<p>Reply Link Polly June 19, , 3: I was on it for eleven years. Do you remember what the last dose was before you went to zero? Anyone who has had this experience — I would love to hear from you! Thank you so much. Reply Link Laurie May 16, , 3: Decided I needed to go off of it to see if I still actually need it. Got down to  Went to the doctor last week and she prescribed clonidine to help with the withdrawal.</p>
<p>The recommended dosage was every hours as needed. I found I could get away with 1 pill every 24 hours. Well last Saturday I started feeling nauseous, dizzy, headache, confused, tingly all the same symptoms as with the Effexor withdrawal so I Increased the clonidine to the recommended dosage of 1 every 6 hours. By Sunday night I was a disaster. And I also would cry every time I opened my mouth! Had to take the day off work and went back to my doctor yesterday and she was shocked that I had that reaction to the clonidine and also that I still had any Effexor left in my system.</p>
<p>The last time I took an Effexor was a week ago today. But today I still have the tingliness, lack of concentration and focus, headache, brain fog.</p>
<p>It was manageable but still not great. I was told it should be gone after hours which is clearly very wrong. Sorry this is so long. I just want off this drug to find out who I actually am without it. Have been very emotionally flat while taking it.</p>
<p>Reply Link Catherine May 20, , 2: Eat healthy and exercise. I loved that a few months down the track I started to experience emotions again, to have fun in life again. I love how I now have clarity of thought. Everyday it gets easier. You can do this. Reply Link deb June 16, , 8: I have been on this drug for the last 10 years. I was on eventually went down to  This was done very slowly. Finally I tapered off to 37 for several weeks now I am off and have been for at least a month.</p>
<p>I still feel very moody emotional and oh yes — cranky. I sure hope this stops soon. My husband asked what is wrong with me. I am trying so hard and I am not going back there. Ten years ago it was the cancer that had gotten me started — and a recent cancer again kept me on this powerful drug. Well now I am cancer free again and effexor free.</p>
<p>I sure hope these withdraws get better soon. I kinda want to get on with life. Although I will say this drug helped me though a really tough time of not knowing how long I was going to be here. To be tested twice was hell — so it did really help me emotionally. Thanks for the input. And yes I fought cancer — so I can do this too. Yup now I am getting emotional. I just finished tapering off took a couple of months of horrible withdrawals, so I completely understand!</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was how clear I was thinking — no foggy brain. My symptoms are mostly gone now but occasionally feel a minor brain zap once and a while.</p>
<p>Combinations of SNRIs and MAOIs may lead to serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including very high body temperature, muscle rigidity, rapid fluctuations of heart rate and blood pressure, extreme agitation progressing to delirium , and coma. Similar reactions may occur if duloxetine is combined with antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other drugs that affect serotonin in the brain.</p>
<p>Examples include tryptophan , sumatriptan Imitrex , lithium , linezolid Zyvox , tramadol Ultram , and St. Fluoxetine Prozac , Sarafem , paroxetine Paxil , Paxil CR , Pexeva , fluvoxamine Luvox , and quinidine increase blood levels of duloxetine by reducing its metabolism in the liver. Such combinations may increase adverse effects of duloxetine. Combining duloxetine with aspirin , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs , warfarin Coumadin or other drugs that are associated with bleeding may increase the risk of bleeding, because duloxetine itself is associated with bleeding.</p>
<p>After all, no one can know everything about everything. This med is for emotional mental, if you will problems, not medical ones, so you should be seeing a shrink, not someone that treats colds and earaches.</p>
<p>Please consider doing so The taboo of seeing a psychiatrist is all but gone in today's society, so if you need to go, go. I'm impressed that you figured out that it was withdrawal! When I decided I didn't need Zoloft anymore several years ago and stopped, I was in the emergency room two weeks later with terrible withdrawal, unaware of what the weird symtoms could be I felt like such an idoit describing my symtoms!</p>
<p>The doc kept asking me if I was taking anything and I kept saying no I wasn't taking anything. I got back on a lower dose and stepped down Unfortunately for me, I had stopped my therapy and, as a result, did not improve and went through several more years of unexplained depression before being properly treated.</p>
<p>Now, I take Efexxor for Dysthymia finally got the right diagnosis, I think-it's a hard one to diagnose for the first several years and occasionally, when I run out or forget to take it for days , I get the same symptoms, but know what it is and get back on.</p></p>
