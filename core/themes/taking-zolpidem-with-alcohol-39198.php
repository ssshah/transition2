		<p><p>NIDA explains that teens experiencing stressful situations or having trouble coping are particularly interested in experimenting with Ambien.</p>
<p>Teens can benefit from education and discussions on the dangers of prescription drug and alcohol abuse. Because prescription drugs come from legitimate sources i. It's important to speak with your teen on a regular basis to go over the dangers of abusing substances of any kind. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism maintains an excellent article about the realities of mixing alcohol with prescription medicine.</p>
<p>This is also where the problem lies, though. People who take Ambien according to prescribed methods are well aware not to mix it with Alcohol. Approximately 38 million prescriptions for zolpidem drugs were written between and  Adding Alcohol to Ambien will amplify its effects and vice versa.</p>
<p>Sedatives are addictive on their own and regular use of Alcohol and Ambien together will lead to psychological and physical dependency. Using alcohol and Ambien together can result in the person not having conscious control over behaviors, causing the individual to engage in activities that would not normally be considered if the person were not under the influence of these substances.</p>
<p>However, this dangerous misconception has resulted in inadvertent overdose or other issues when individuals have participated in normal activities without realizing the effects the drug might have.</p>
<p>As explained by the National Council on Patient Information and Education , prescription drugs are not safer to abuse just because they are legal when used as prescribed.

Many people do so, thinking that the effects of mixing zolpidem also know as Ambien and alcohol are don't exist or are too minimal to matter. On the contrary, the effects of mixing the prescription drug and alcohol can be quite severe if they aren't taken seriously. However, before you can understand the effects of mixing the substances, you must learn a thing or two about the way these drugs interact.</p>
<p>How the Two Drugs Work Zolpidem is a sedative and a hypnotic substance that is used to treat insomnia and difficulty sleeping. The small pill can be taken without water and is extremely powerful for new users. Alcohol is a depressant that also affects the muscles and nervous system.
