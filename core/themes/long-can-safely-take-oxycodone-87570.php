		<p><p>When you feel down, or depressed, or anxious, or seeking drugs in your withdrawal, remember that your brain is healing and trying to learn how to give your joy again naturally. The world will turn from black and white to color again, and it will trickle in a bit more each day.</p>
<p>Embrace journal about it! Get Help Do whatever it takes to abstain. If you feel like you need a taper plan and that would work best for you, do it.</p>
<p>If you feel like suboxone or methadone replacement therapy would work, do it. If you would rather read about others stories and write about them yourself, do it. Learn Joy Again Try to find joy again in your life without being dependent on something or someone. Play the guitar, garden, chase your kid around the house, eat an oatmeal cream pie, draw, organize your spice rack, win the little battles that give you joy and you will eventually re-learn how to have joy without the drugs.</p>
<p>Reply Link BeenThere August 23, ,  I decided to take my life back back in January of this year. Unfortunately, physical withdrawal has been a different matter, altogether.</p>
<p>I suppose herein lies my point: Oxys are absolute garbage. If I knew then what I know now, I would have absolutely owned the pain back then and stuck with non-opioid medications. This stuff, at least for me, will likely take years to recover from. That being said, every day that goes by is a better day. Nothing could make me go back to that junk. Reply Link systematic-reset August 16, , 4: And well folks, my comments are as follows. And please know, Im offering this, only because I feel inspired to do so.</p>
<p>I know my dependance on Oxycodone, came from a personal choice I made, after consulting with a pain management doctor. I know I have not been dependent long, and that in comparison to some, I have been on a mild daily dose. I know some of you are going through a far greater struggle. I believe in you however! I trust our bodies can and WILL repair and heal. That said, here goes… My initial detox, days were absolute hell. Distressing horror, Im proud to say, I survived! I would pray or continually say a mantra of which Im still doing constantly.</p>
<p>I did all this, while physically allowing for as much comfort and rest as possible. Laying in bed, as though I was recovering from a nasty FLU. Thank God I had the grace-allowance, of being off work, to go through these initial phases.</p>
<p>Topical Arnica Montana or Moon Valley Organics, Muscle Rub, have seemed to offer some aid… I even found a forum that suggested the placement of a bar of soap under the bed sheet; stating that this bizarre trick, helps with RLS… Yes, I too, have a bar of soap under my bed sheet! On day one through three, I drank this hot beverage several times! Magnesium can loosen stools, so those of you who still suffer the runs, please note this. Days 4, 5 and 6, were interesting.</p>
<p>My horrific detox phase had passed, gospel music … though, I still suffered mild to moderate leg cramping and quite honestly, hellish RLS at night. Telling myself all these things, helped me to get grounded, and push through the days. Today, day 7, after another unrestful sleep, thanks to the persisting RLS and dull aching within my legs… People, I actually feeling pretty good!</p>
<p>Im not experiencing any anxiety, Im not feeling overwhelmingly sluggish. I will, no doubt, encounter more uncomfortable experiences in the coming days and weeks. And as they arise, I will, and with kind and gentle self love, acknowledge my progress, remember my goal, remember, this is a process, and look ahead in ernest embrace, that my true-natured self is coming back every moment, I endure and allow for this healing. I know many of you are suffering.</p>
<p>For that I empathetically offer love and encouragement. YOU and I are so much more than just our physical bodies! Dependance can be overcome! My very best to all of you! One moment at a time! YOU can do this! Thanks for reading, systematic-reset Reply Link Karl August 13, , 2: Very slight anxiety still but that will soon pass. I have never been so happy in my entire life. My pain has returned but now I have control over it better than I did prior to getting addicted to OXY.</p>
<p>I quit cold turkey and I had people doubt me that I would be able to do it. I think the secret to my success is first and foremost, my belief in God, and secondly my will power to never fail in anything I choose to take on.</p>
<p>There is so much beauty in the world that being on OXY only clouds your vision and makes you into somebody that your not.</p>
<p>Those of you starting your journey, keep in your mind that your suffering will end. The prize being, your LIFE back. Never give up everyone, the human spirit has more strength than you know, all you have to do is believe. God Bless and take care. Reply Link Karl August 9, , 4: Last night was brutal, with every bone in my body aching like I got run over by a truck but for some reason this morning, I smiled for the first time in months.</p>
<p>It makes me proud to know that no matter what I have to deal with, I have the inner strength to overcome. I hope all of you are still on the path to a better life. And any of you would like to drop me an email, I will most gladly reply to you. I believe in paying it forward. If we all do just that one thing, maybe, just maybe we can help the world. I almost gave this battle up but something inside me told me and reminded me a story my massage therapist told me.</p>
<p>The story goes like this. Listen to it and act accordingly. I will tell all you Canadians on here some advice. I know a lot of people in the med field and they all told me the same thing.</p>
<p>If you ever get into a situation where you end up in the hospital, and you are in a lot of pain, there are three drugs that they will give you, morphine, hydromorphone, and OXY. They recommended that everyone tell their physician to put in your medical records that you are allergic and no pain meds be administered. And guess what I did. I did just that. It is now in my charts and no matter where I go, it is official. They also mentioned that if you find yourself in that situation to have a friend, partner or love one , inform them as well to make sure it is carried out.</p>
<p>This may be overkill but I certainly do not want that garbage in my system ever again. Well wish everyone all the best and like the old saying anything worth getting is never easy. Keep your eye on the prize. Reply Link Karl August 8, , 2: It feels really good not being tied to a life of Oxy. There are so many of us on or were on the pill, makes you wonder what the medical profession is doing to the human population. If the trend continues, there will be no normal people left.</p>
<p>It will be a drug induced world of a bunch of mindless zombies looking to get their next fix. Once my head is glued on correctly again. There has been so much over the years I have missed being an OXY addict and I want to make up for lost time. We only live one life and we should all embrace however we can cause the years go by so quickly.</p>
<p>Just remember it down the line of how much you went through to get normal again. By remembering it, it will give you more strength than you ever thought possible. Reply Link Karl Aschenbrener August 6, , 6: I have recently quit taking OxyContin for one main reason, it may me into a totally different person.</p>
<p>I would get up in the morning and first though was where are my pills. So I woke up one day and realize that I wanted my life back and just up and quit.</p>
<p>Well the first day was like hell. But I prayed to God to help me with my journey and he answered my prayers. No more thinking about the pills, feeling like I was human again, and extremely happier. Well I on my 7th day and I have made it over the hump. I now know I will never return to that world of drug dependency and I will share this or try to help someone through this because up it is all worth it. I took all my pills back to the pharmacy, stricken off my file and now I am free from that hell.</p>
<p>One word of advice for you all, just take one day at a time, once you get through the first day, the second is easier, and so on down the line. Stay focused on your goal, and never lose sight of a better you. Now taking just 2. Reply Link Ron July 13, ,  The repair was going to be a fusion using titanium and cadaver one. Come to find out he severed the nerve. So I tried everything two to three times; acupuncture twice, physical therapy three times, two pain clinics, then drugs.</p>
<p>Looking back now I realize that many things in my life were lost. The best band that I ever sang for as front man, gone. This is my number one regret, the loss of that opportunity, that time.</p>
<p>I also could not deal with anything emotionally very well at all. Relationships with those closest to me suffered more than I will every know or every be able to repair. My daddy was a honky-tonk man and I wanted to be just like him singing and playing bars all over the north country. Well I lost him at 10 because he was drunk and hit a tree sideways and always felt that he died for a buzz and left me behind.</p>
<p>Reply Link Jenni Bean July 9, ,  I have tried to quit before and I turned into the girl in the exorcist!!! I also would fantasize that I would get sent to jail or something forced like being tied to a hospital bed… what would be the the one thing that would make me have the determination to stop.</p>
<p>I was tired of being a slave by these blue pills and obsessing about them. I was tired of being treated like a drug seeker at doctors and pharmacists.</p>
<p>I was tired of not being able to travel to long or even move to another country because my blue pill chain was here in the U. So yes I feel many symptoms. I am freezing and roasting in sweat all the time. I have NO hunger at all but am drinking lots of water, orange juice and coconut milk. But I am so determined. Every time I look at the clock and see I have gone 2 more hours is a blessing.</p>
<p>There is so much more much more however I am so determined to do this that I will win!!! I was taking to Oxy Cotton 30 milligram pills a day and I immediately called my doctor and told her that this pill only lasted 6 hours.</p>
<p>She said that by taking Oxycontin I would not have the ups and downs of taking the oxycodone every 4 to 6 hours. This is extremely wrong and not the case. Once my doctor figured out that my pain was not being broken with the 30 milligram pills she said take a 30 milligram pill every 8 hours so I was taking 90 milligrams of OxyContin a day which after six hours or less I had to take 20 to 30 milligrams of oxy codeine so I ended up taking an extra 50 to 60 milligrams of OxyContin a day for a grand total of milligrams a day.</p>
<p>This is simply the worst thing you can do if your body. If I can recommend anything do not get on oxycontin. I went and tapered myself down to 90 milligrams and had a hernia surgery and then had to boost back up to and then and and started tapering down and when I got to 3 10 milligram Oxycontin pills I tried to go to the oxy codeine pills which was literally impossible.</p>
<p>I had to taper off the Oxycontin first and then I had to taper off the oxy codeine. The Oxy Cotton is 10 times more addictive forming to your body and brain.</p>
<p>Once I got down to 10 milligrams I simply cut the 5 milligram pills in half and then in quarters and took one every 4 to 6 hours and tried to go without at night then I drop down to 7 milligrams and then 5 milligrams and then I took 1. This low taper work for me at the end even though I was much fast are dropping down from  I hope this helps people out there to not take Oxycontin at all costs. It is the worst drug. I am still having side effects 18 days after my last pill and I have been having panic attacks and insomnia with extreme soreness of muscles.</p>
<p>I have been taking Epsom salts bath with sea salt and been using a lot of DMSO on my store joints and muscles. Also taking omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil is extremely important for a good quality sardines to block information. I also use turmeric and bone broth to reheat my body and reduce inflammation. I hope this help somebody in this world and I hope that you listen to my advice is the yo-yo and effect of pain medication is twice as bad on Oxy Cotton do not go there. Take care and peace out.</p>
<p>Reply Link lana June 22, , 9: I am constantly tired and sick to my stomach. Any advice on how to deal with the stomach issue? We think they have done other things to my body. Oxycontin oxycodone extended-release is a prescription medication approved to treat moderate to severe pain. It is a strong narcotic painkiller that should not be used to treat mild or short-term pain. Oxycontin is meant to be used around the clock at scheduled times twice a day. It is not approved for "as needed" use unscheduled use only when needed.</p>
<p>Taking Oxycontin three times daily instead of the officially recommended twice daily dosage is a common off-label use of the drug. It is not appropriate for treating pain after a surgery, unless your pain is expected to be moderate to severe and long-lasting. Some side effects with Oxycontin are potentially serious and should be reported immediately to your health care provider.</p>
<p>These include, but are not limited to: Oxycontin is a very effective pain medication that can be quite safe when used properly. However, it also has significant abuse potential. As with other narcotics, the body becomes physically dependent upon Oxycontin.</p>
<p>This is a predictable, physical response to long-term use of the narcotic. The body becomes accustomed to physical changes that Oxycontin causes, and stopping the drug will lead to withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that physical dependence on Oxycontin is not necessarily a sign of addiction, at least in the sense that most people use the term.</p>
<p>Even people taking Oxycontin responsibly for a legitimate medical purpose will become physically dependent on the drug. Friends and family can keep an eye out for signs of addiction, such as: Secluded behavior, often needing to spend large amounts of time alone Stealing, lying, or other dishonest behavior An unexplainable lack of money Changes in social circles, such as abandoning good friends and replacing them with new ones Unexplained changes in mood or behaviors.</p>
<p>If there are concerns in regard to this medication, the physician should be consulted as they know the patient and his condition. Here is some information on Oxycontin: How long does oxycodone with Tylenol stay in your system if you take your prescribed amount? Is it only six hours or less then that? The half-life of a drug is the amount of time it takes for one-half of the dose to be eliminated from the body.</p>
<p>The half-life of oxycodone-acetaminophen is between three and four and a half hours. Dosing is based on everyone's uniquely individual response to pain medications, and the type of pain and its expected duration.</p>
<p>Also, if the pain is chronic or of a very long duration, then a tolerance will be built up over time and the dose will need to be adjusted. Every four hours is a commonly prescribed frequency for oxycodone-acetaminophen. It is essential to frequently check with one Q: Can Oxycontin cause you excessive sweating? Sweating can be a common side effect of Oxycontin oxycodone. If you find the side effect bothersome, contact your health care provider.</p>
<p>What is the best way to wean yourself off to mgs of oxycodone daily? Without knowing more information such as your medical history, how long have you been using oxycodone, the type of pain, and your other current medications, it would be too dangerous to council you on how to wean yourself off this very potent narcotic painkiller.</p>
<p>This really is a question your physician should answer for you. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action.
