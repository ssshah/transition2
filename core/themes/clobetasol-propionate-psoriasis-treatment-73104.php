		<p><p>If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away with water.

This medicine should only be used for skin conditions that your doctor is treating. Check with your doctor before using it for other conditions, especially if you think that a skin infection may be present.</p>
<p>This medicine should not be used to treat certain kinds of skin infections or conditions, such as severe burns. Do not use this medicine on the face, groin, or underarms, or have skin thinning unless directed to do so by your doctor.</p>
<p>To use the cream, foam, gel, lotion, ointment, or spray: Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine. Apply a thin layer of this medicine to the affected area of the skin. Rub it in gently. With the lotion, protect the skin from water, clothing, or anything that causes rubbing until the medicine has dried. Also, shake the lotion well before using it. With the foam, do not dispense directly from the can into your hands, unless the hands are the affected area. Do not bandage or otherwise wrap the skin being treated unless directed to do so by your doctor.</p>
<p>To use the foam, scalp solution, or shampoo: Apply a thin layer of this medicine to the affected area of the scalp. Do not cover the scalp eg, shower cap, bathing cap while it is being treated. With the shampoo, do not wet your hair before using it. And if the shampoo gets on any part of your body other than your scalp, rinse the area well with water. Do not use the shampoo for more than 4 weeks, the foam and scalp solution for more than 2 weeks unless your doctor has told you to.</p>
<p>This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. Dosing The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p>
<p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p>
<p>For redness, itching, and swelling of the skin: For topical dosage forms cream, gel, or ointment: Adults—Apply to the affected area of the skin two times per day. Limit treatment to 2 consecutive weeks. Avoid use of OLUX Foam in the diaper area, as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing. The product is flammable; avoid heat, flame, and smoking when applying this product. Do not use other corticosteroid-containing products without first consulting with the physician.</p>
<p>In a day repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, topical administration of clobetasol propionate foam at dose concentrations from 0. A no observable adverse effect level could not be determined in this study. Although the clinical relevance of the findings in animals to humans is not clear, sustained glucocorticoid-related immune suppression may increase the risk of infection and possibly the risk for carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Clobetasol propionate was nonmutagenic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma test, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene conversion assay, and the E. Studies in the rat following subcutaneous administration of clobetasol propionate at dosage levels up to 0. Published data report a significantly increased risk of low birthweight with the use of greater than grams of potent or very potent topical corticosteroid during a pregnancy.</p>
<p>Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and to use OLUX Foam on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible see Data. In animal reproduction studies, increased malformations, such as cleft palate and skeletal abnormalities, were observed after subcutaneous administration of clobetasol propionate to pregnant mice and rabbits.</p>
<p>No comparison of animal exposure with human exposure was computed. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. Data Human Data Multiple observational studies found no significant associations between maternal use of topical corticosteroids of any potency and congenital malformations, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality.</p>
<p>However, when the dispensed amount of potent or very potent topical corticosteroid exceeded g during the entire pregnancy, use was associated with an increase in low birth weight infants [adjusted RR, 7. Malformations seen included cleft palate and skeletal abnormalities. In an embryofetal development study in rabbits, subcutaneous administration of clobetasol propionate resulted in malformations at doses of 0.</p>
<p>Malformations seen included cleft palate, cranioschisis, and other skeletal abnormalities. Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of clobetasol propionate in breast milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production.</p>
<p>Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and can suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of clobetasol propionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk.</p>
<p>Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use OLUX Foam on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply OLUX Foam directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of OLUX Foam in patients younger than 12 years of age have not been established; therefore, use in children younger than 12 years is not recommended.</p>
<p>Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when they are treated with topical drugs.</p></p>
