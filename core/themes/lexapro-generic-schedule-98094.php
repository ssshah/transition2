		<p><p>Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Lexapro before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications 4.</p>
<p>Use of Lexapro with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue Do not start Lexapro in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [see Contraindications 4.</p>
<p>In some cases, a patient already receiving Lexapro therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, Lexapro should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered.</p>
<p>Before using this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: Escitalopram may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm QT prolongation.</p>
<p>The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using escitalopram, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about using escitalopram safely. Labor And Delivery The effect of Lexapro on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers Escitalopram is excreted in human breast milk. Limited data from women taking mg escitalopram showed that exclusively breast-fed infants receive approximately 3.</p>
<p>There were two reports of infants experiencing excessive somnolence , decreased feeding, and weight loss in association with breastfeeding from a racemic citalopram-treated mother; in one case, the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of racemic citalopram by its mother and, in the second case, no follow-up information was available.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised and breastfeeding infants should be observed for adverse reactions when Lexapro is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro have been established in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age for the treatment of major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies ]. Although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients with major depressive disorder has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients.</p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of Lexapro have not been established in pediatric younger than 12 years of age patients with major depressive disorder. In a week, open- label safety study in children aged 7 to 11 years who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for Lexapro.</p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro has not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as Lexapro.</p>
<p>The number of elderly patients in these trials was insufficient to adequately assess for possible differential efficacy and safety measures on the basis of age. Nevertheless, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals to effects of Lexapro cannot be ruled out. SSRIs and SNRIs, including Lexapro, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [see Hyponatremia].</p>
<p>Of patients in clinical studies of racemic citalopram, were 60 and over, were 65 and over, and were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but again, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals cannot be ruled out. During the postmarketing evaluation of escitalopram, Lexapro overdoses involving overdoses of over mg have been reported.</p>
<p>As with other SSRIs, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of escitalopram has been rarely reported. Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose. Management Of Overdose Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care.</p>
<p>Due to the large volume of distribution of escitalopram, forced diuresis , dialysis , hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for Lexapro. Escitalopram can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. Lexapro should not be given to a child younger than 12 years old. How should I take Lexapro? Take Lexapro exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label.</p>
<p>Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. You may take Lexapro with or without food. Try to take the medicine at the same time each day. Measure liquid medicine with the dosing syringe provided, or with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup.</p></p>
