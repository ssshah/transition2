		<p><p>Try diclofenac for the aches associated with dt's if you can get it. I don't know if it will help through the night which for me is the worst but I know I'm able to sit at my desk all day without hammering a hole in the ground with my foot when I take it.</p>
<p>It's a non-steroid anti-inflamatory like ibprofren except stonger. It's non narcotic and not an opiat.</p>
<p>It will not make you feel any different drowsy etc. Read More 5 mg of hydrocodone which is the opioid narcotic component and mg of acetaminophen tylenol. These two medications are in totally different classes However, these two medicines should really not be compared in that fashion as they each work better than the other for different types of ailments.</p>
<p>Read More I use glucosamine, chondroitin, cod liver oil and ensure my diet contains oily fish. TENS doesn't work, heat does work to a degree and so I try to utilise this as much as possible, hydrotherapy is beneficial but not to the bank balance! So if anyone has any bright ideas be the natural remedies or prescribed then please let me know! Read More I am becoming somewhat frustrated with the way a lot of my colleagues practice medicine. Disenchanted, angry would be the other words that could be used.</p>
<p>We all get ostensibly that same training and all of us are supposedly in it to help our patients. So, how come have I been getting so many letters lately on my addiction forum from desperate people unable to quit taking the tramadol pills that their own kind doctors have so freely prescribed for them? Read More He says it's not SJ problems because occasionally the pain radiates to my left side, it's low back pain, but does want to see mri files just to be sure.</p>
<p>He gives me more hydrocodone , lower dose, and a different anti-inflammatory, and a PT order. And I think, how is this happening? How is low back pain so bad you are sobbing in the ER, then it just starts to go away a month later?!?! But I soooo want him to be right. Read More I have to go to pain management and take 60 mg of Cymbalta for nerve pain really nasty to get on and worse getting off but has stopped my restless leg syndrome , diclofenac nsaid, hydrocodone and extended release morphine.</p>
<p>And I'm still always in pain! I took valtrex for over a year and it didn't help me. What saved me when working and when I'm not super sick is extended release adderall.</p>
<p>I still have pain, but I finally have a pretty good regiment that works for me. Read More In such cases it is very important to note any other conditions like stress, confusion, memory loss, alcohol, drug, and medication history hydrocodone is also important.</p>
<p>As it is evident that hydrocodone might have led to hallucinations. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: Call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects: However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related.</p>
<p>The usual adult dosage is one tablet every four to six hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage should not exceed 6 tablets. They are supplied as white with green specks, capsule-shaped, bisected tablets, debossed "ucb" on one side and "" on the other side, in containers of tablets NDC , and tablets NDC  These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in non-ambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down.</p>
<p>Other adverse reactions include: Drowsiness, mental clouding, lethargy, impairment of mental and physical performance, anxiety , fear, dysphoria , psychic dependence, mood changes. Prolonged administration of Lortab 7. Ureteral spasm , spasm of vesical sphincters and urinary retention have been reported with opiates. Cases of hearing impairment or permanent loss have been reported predominantly in patients with chronic overdose.</p>
<p>The following adverse drug events may be borne in mind as potential effects of acetaminophen: Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of narcotics; therefore, this product should be prescribed and administered with caution. However, psychic dependence is unlikely to develop when hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets are used for a short time for the treatment of pain.</p>
<p>Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued narcotic use, although some mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of narcotic therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia , is manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia.</p>
<p>The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. At high doses or in sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory center. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing.</p>
<p>Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure: The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p>
<p>As with any narcotic analgesic agent, Lortab 7. The usual precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind. Hydrocodone suppresses the cough reflex; as with all narcotics, caution should be exercised when Lortab 7.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether hydrocodone or acetaminophen have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting and fever.</p>
<p>The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. There is no consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal. As with all narcotics, administration of this product to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used. Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known.</p>
<p>It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established.</p>
<p>Clinical studies of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p>
<p>In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney.</p></p>
