		<p><p>Avoid tasks that require mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery. Avoid drinking alcohol while taking this medicine. Prevent and treat constipation.</p>
<p>Constipation is a common side effect when taking this medicine for more than a few days. Exercising, eating fiber, and drinking water can help, but you may need to ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend a laxative. If your constipation seems severe or does not respond to laxatives, call your doctor. This can be a sign of a blockage in your bowels, a rare but serious side effect. When discarding unused medicine 7.</p>
<p>Gastric bypass patients can take iron salts combined with ascorbic acid vitamin C to acidify the stomach and facilitate absorption. Vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, which is produced in the bypassed part of the stomach, as well as acid; a lack of these can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia. Medications and Marginal Ulcers Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications NSAIDs , such as Advil, Motrin, Aleve, Excedrin and Celebrex, are used primarily to treat inflammation, fever and mild to moderate pain from headaches, arthritis, sports injuries and menstrual cramps.</p>
<p>Taking NSAIDs after gastric bypass surgery significantly increases the risk of developing marginal ulcers at the connection between the stomach pouch and the Roux limb. Thus, gastric bypass patients should avoid these medications. The same risk extends to the salicylates i. Safer options for oral pain medications include acetaminophen and opioids Percocet, Vicodin, Tylenol 3 and Tramadol.</p>
<p>Oral biphosphonates are another type of medication that may produce marginal ulcers in gastric bypass patients. However, there are alternative treatment options available, such as calcitonin salmon nasal spray, synthetic parathyroid hormone and Raloxifene. Anti-acid medications Nexium, Protonix or Prevacid are prescribed to prevent ulcers in the gastric pouch. We recommend taking one of these for at least six months following any type of bariatric surgery.</p>
<p>Reduced Medication Effectiveness The shorter intestinal length after gastric bypass or duodenal switch surgery can make extended-release drug preparations less effective. Antibiotics, for example, can irritate the esophagus. However, since they are normally given for a short-term course, they are not as worrisome as other drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs , which people sometimes take over the long term, or bisphosphonates for osteoporosis like alendronate Fosamax , which are intended to be taken continuously.</p>
<p>Other medications that can irritate the esophagus include the heart drug quinidine the blood thinner warfarin Coumadin, Jantoven, generics chemotherapy for esophageal, head and neck, bronchopulmonary, or breast cancer phenytoin Dilantin for seizures the immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil CellCept Over-the-counter supplements such as iron, vitamin C, and potassium also can damage the esophagus.</p>
<p>The excess stomach acid then increases the likelihood of having acid reflux. High blood pressure medications such as calcium channel blockers like diltiazem Cardizem and beta-blockers like propranolol Inderal relax blood vessels, but they also relax the muscles that line the digestive tract and delay the transit of food through the stomach.</p>
<p>Always carry your medication with you. When flying, never put it into a checked bag. Keep it in your carry-on bag. You may need to show airport staff the pharmacy label for your medication. Always carry the original prescription-labeled container with you. Be sure to avoid doing this when the weather is very hot or very cold. Clinical monitoring You must have regular blood tests and visits with your doctor to monitor your condition.</p>
<p>Your diet Some foods and beverages can interact with warfarin and affect your treatment and dosage. While taking this drug, eat a normal, balanced diet, and talk to your healthcare provider before you make any diet changes. These vegetables contain vitamin K. Also, certain vegetable oils also contain large amounts of vitamin K. Too much vitamin K can decrease the effect of warfarin. Are there any alternatives? There are other drugs available to treat your condition.</p>
<p>Some may be better suited for you than others. Talk to your doctor about other drug options that may work for you. Some patients may take warfarin for a few weeks; others will need to take warfarin the rest of their lives. The length of treatment depends on the reason why a patient needs anticoagulants. Warfarin works by slowing down the process in the liver that uses vitamin K to make certain proteins clotting factors that cause clotting.</p>
<p>Because it may take several days before warfarin becomes completely effective, heparin or LMWH is given until the warfarin is working. As with patients who take heparin, patients taking warfarin need to have their blood tested to see how well the drug is working and to be monitored for safety.</p>
<p>This blood test measures how long it takes blood to clot, and is also called a prothrombin time, protime, INR, or clotting time. Because different labs use different methods to measure clotting time, the results of the test can vary. To make sure a doctor can correctly interpret this test, the results are reported with an INR number International Normalized Ratio that converts all clotting times to the same number. People who are not taking warfarin have an INR around 1. Most patients on warfarin should have an INR between 2 and 3; this is considered their therapeutic range.</p>
<p>In some patients, a higher or lower INR range is targeted. If a patient has an INR that is below their therapeutic range, the risk of clotting is higher; if a patient has an INR above the therapeutic range, the risk of bleeding is higher.</p>
<p>When patients first start warfarin, they may get their blood tested two or three times a week. Once patients are on a regular dose of warfarin, they may go as long as 4 weeks between blood tests.</p></p>
