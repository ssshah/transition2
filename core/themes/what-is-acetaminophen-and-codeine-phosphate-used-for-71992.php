        </div>
	 
		<p><p>The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are morphineglucuronide M3G and morphineglucuronide M6G. Morphine and M6G are known to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is unknown. Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to possess analgesic properties. The plasma half-life is about 2. The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces. At therapeutic doses, the analgesic effect reaches a peak within 2 hours and persists between 4 and 6 hours.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways: Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, even at recommended doses [see WARNINGS ], reserve acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is contraindicated in patients with: Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution of different concentrations, when prescribing, dispensing, and administering acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately.</p>
<p>A household teaspoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the risk of mistakenly using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, it is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device.</p>
<p>Health care providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage [see WARNINGS ].</p>
<p>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution contains codeine, a Schedule V controlled substance. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction or mental illness e.</p>
<p>The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p>
<p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p>
<p>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Carbon dioxide CO2 retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p>
<p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution.</p>
<p>Overestimating the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of codeine.</p>
<p>Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype described below , which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine. Based upon postmarketing reports, children less than 12 years old appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death: Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression see WARNINGS.</p>
<p>Nursing Mothers At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution.</p>
<p>Ultra-rapid metabolizer Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype e. These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solutionHypotension.</p>
<p>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate.</p>
<p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</p>
<p>Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Use of cytochrome P 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine. Cytochrome P 3A4 Interaction The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with all cytochrome P 3A4 inhibitors , such as macrolide antibiotics e.</p>
<p>The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with all cytochrome P 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via 2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels.</p>
<p>This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</p>
<p>If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider dosage reduction of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution until stable drug effects are achieved.</p>
<p>Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage until stable drug effects are achieved.</p>
<p>Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P 2D6 Inhibitors The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with all cytochrome P 2D6 inhibitors e.</p>
<p>Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in codeine plasma concentration and an increase in active metabolite morphine plasma concentration which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.</p>
<p>Follow patients receiving acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6.</p>
<p>If concomitant use with a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, follow the patient for signs of reduced efficacy or opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4, milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product.</p>
<p>Paracetamol toxicity Untreated paracetamol overdose results in a lengthy, painful illness. Signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity may initially be absent or non-specific symptoms. The first symptoms of overdose usually begin several hours after ingestion, with nausea , vomiting , sweating, and pain as acute liver failure starts.</p>
<p>Paracetamol hepatotoxicity is by far the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replenishing glutathione.</p>
<p>While the antidote, acetylcysteine also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC , acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver, a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. I was mentally unstable. One day my sister invited me to church and I gave my life to Christ, it wasn't easy, but the new found company of the holy spirit gave me that strength, love courage and determination to get through it - not to mention the peace I found which filled up all the emptiness I had away from the codeine dosage - can't explain but just some kind amazing transformation takes place on the inside and I know it was GOD hearing my cries for help and saving me from death I cried uncontrollably when I was touched by the holy spirit like a huge weight had lifted off my shoulder and I was like a caged bird set free - I truly believe it was GOD saying to me, you've suffered enough, you don't have to suffer anymore I'm not asking you to believe me, I'm asking you to try it for yourself.</p>
<p>You can't do this on your own - it's too painful, too difficult and beyond your control I truly am a broken mess put back together, it's a miracle I am still alive!!! I am a living testimony of this!!! Reply Mike May 29th, Hi, I find codeine really helpful. I get stressed and anxious at times. I find that codeine really relaxes me and assists in a positive way, relaxes my mind and makes me feel good, so affecting my thoughts positively.</p>
<p>I occasionally use it. I think there is a time and place for codeine. Its an opiate, derived from the opium poppy. Different cultures use opium to relax. I like drugs I think they can act in a positive way when used correctly. Thank you Mr poppy. Poppy, I shouldn't laugh but at the moment you occasionally use. If you ever get strung out you'll be cursing Mr.</p>
<p>Poppy, its agony when you 'need' it. Seo Services June 9th, Nice post. So I want some information for sharing this site with some of my friends. Reply Ruth August 29th, I have only been taking codeine 3 weeks am definitely reliant on it only took small dosage 10 20 mgs prior to that was only taking 2 mg of Valium which I was finally sleeping on came to visit family and my routine was thrown off had pain so took codeine now life is pure hell maybe because of my weight it was too much for me I weigh 46 kg now I can't eat much again have severe depression I did have depression before but I was coping OK with it and anxiety now it has worsened to the extent I am so lethargic feel I want codeine and cannot sleep at all without it but on it sleep one two hours then wake am talking to myself feel jittery etc.</p>
<p>It's been pure hell I've only just got some life back after Valium affected me I feel like I'm dying but its slow I suddenly have no interest in anything again where I was beginning to find interest stay away from this drug my daughter able to get it as work at chemist she doesn't seem to become addicted to prescription meds at all. I can take them or leave them why are some people so unlucky I've also lost weight since taking them I had to fight for years to put on 8 kgs.</p>
<p>Reply Eileen October 8th, After years of mg of codeine per day I have been off it for 2 weeks. I live in France and was able to buy it in the chemists. I never tapered down; I knew that would never work so I just stopped taking it. I have seen on different forums that it is recommended to take time off work to do this but I did the complete opposite. Knowing that I had to go to work and didn't have any choice spurred me on. The irritable feet and hands and not being able to sleep well at night were probably the worst symptoms.</p>
<p>I felt irritable but a good idea is to keep your mind busy. Never sit around without something to do, it only gives you time to think about how difficult cold turkey is going to be. I must admit that I thought that I was going to have cold sweats and shaking hands but that never happened, although the sleep deprivation was really depressing. I feel a lot better now and know that I'm not at the end of the tunnel but at least I can see the light.</p>
<p>This medication is as bad as any other illegal drug. OK, at the base of all this, we are taking this drug and are addicted because probably we have psychological hang-ups, we probably all started out having some kind of pain or other and just carried on taking it because it does make us feel good. BUT, yes we can die from abuse, and for years, I was a completely different person. My whole personality changed. I was full of energy most of the time and very outgoing.</p>
<p>As soon as it wore off I'd take some more. Now I'm feeling aches and pains that were masked by the codeine. I'm scared that if ever I have to be hospitalized and need pain medication, I'm not going to react to it because I've become tolerant. I'm looking forward to losing weight, I became so bloated. I have to resist the urge to take codeine when I have bad headaches, probably a symptom of coming off the codeine.</p>
<p>Anybody out there addicted, you will all find an excuse, a pain here and there to take more, BUT the benefits long-term of stopping are so worth it. I am very weak willed but I managed it so anyone can. The first week is now a blur, I used sleeping pills the first weekend without codeine to try and sleep through cold turkey. That helped a bit but it was not quality sleep. There are more people out there that are addicted than you would be believe.</p>
<p>Be strong and have faith. Fix a goal ahead of you and think of that when it gets tough. I still have codoliprane in the house just to prove how determined I am to keep off it. I believe that I would have to be absolutely dying before I would even consider taking it again, in fact I may as well be.</p>
<p>I don't know what damage I have done to my body; I am asking my Doc this week to check my liver. Whatever, it's too late now. These forums are great to share these problems. Reply Stiffler October 9th, I have been an addict of codeine for a year now.. I normally take it because I use it to sleep at night and without codeine I can't sleep.</p>
<p>Reply Tyco November 4th, I have been taking Tylenol with codeine for a little over a month, and I'm already feeling dependent on it. I've had back pain for several years I have three vertebrae out of place, but the doctors will not do anything about it - they just threw me on some pain meds and told me I was good to go. I refused to take them for months, but now that I have a new job that requires being on my feet all day, I started again because the pain became unbearable. Not only am I dealing with this new job, but many other changes have been going on.</p>
<p>Now I feel alone while I am facing 'adult' matters for the first time. I discovered that the pain meds relieved my back pain At first I'd just take them when I got home from a long day at work for the pain. Signs and Symptoms Codeine Toxicity from codeine poisoning includes the opioid triad of: Acetaminophen In acetaminophen overdosage, dose-dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect.</p>
<p>Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma and thrombocytopenia may also occur. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion. In adults, hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with acute overdoses of less than 10 grams or fatalities with less than 15 grams.</p>
<p>Treatment A single or multiple overdose with acetaminophen and codeine is a potentially lethal polydrug overdose and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption.</p>
<p>Vomiting should be induced mechanically, or with syrup of ipecac , if the patient is alert adequate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes. The first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic. If repeated doses are used, the cathartic might be included with alternate doses as required. Hypotension is usually hypovolemic and should respond to fluids. Vasopressors and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.</p>
<p>A cuffed endo-tracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the unconscious patient and, when necessary, to provide assisted respiration. Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation.</p>
<p>In severe cases of intoxication, peritoneal dialysis , or preferably hemodialysis , may be considered. If hypoprothrombinemia occurs due to acetaminophen overdose, vitamin K should be administered intravenously. Naloxone , a narcotic antagonist , can reverse respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose. Since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration.</p>
<p>A narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained, since levels four or more hours following ingestion help predict acetaminophen toxicity. Do not await acetaminophen assay results before initiating treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be obtained initially, and repeated at hour intervals.</p></p>
