<p>Pharmacy Rx World contracts with a Canadian pharmacy, international pharmacies and dispensaries. Height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine. Mutagenicity Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have been shown to have no genotoxic effects based on the following assays: Impairment Of Fertility Two fertility studies conducted in adult rats at doses of up to 7. However, adverse effects on fertility were seen when juvenile rats were treated with fluoxetine [see Use In Specific Populations].</p>
<p>All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects , loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. Treatment Of Pregnant Women During The First Trimester There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies on the use of fluoxetine in pregnant women. Results of a number of published epidemiological studies assessing the risk of fluoxetine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy have demonstrated inconsistent results.</p>
<p>More than 10 cohort studies and case-control studies failed to demonstrate an increased risk for congenital malformations overall. There was no specific pattern of cardiovascular malformations.</p>
<p>Overall, however, a causal relationship has not been established. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis , apnea , seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia , hypertonia , hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying.</p>
<p>PPHN occurs in 1 -2 per 1, live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of pregnant women with a history of major depression , who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period , and were in remission.</p>
<p>Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy.</p>
<p>When treating a pregnant woman with PROZAC, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity following administration of fluoxetine at doses up to  However, because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility that fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>In one breast-milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine was  No adverse effects on the infant were reported. In another case, an infant nursed by a mother on PROZAC developed crying, sleep disturbance, vomiting, and watery stools.</p>
<p>Manic reaction, including mania and hypomania, was reported in 6 1 mania, 5 hypomania out of 2. As with other SSRIs, decreased weight gain has been observed in association with the use of fluoxetine in children and adolescent patients. After 19 weeks of treatment in a clinical trial, pediatric subjects treated with fluoxetine gained an average of 1.</p>
<p>In addition, fluoxetine treatment was associated with a decrease in alkaline phosphatase levels. The safety of fluoxetine treatment for pediatric patients has not been systematically assessed for chronic treatment longer than several months in duration. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the longer-term effects of fluoxetine on the growth, development and maturation of children and adolescent patients.</p>
<p>Therefore, height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine. Anyone considering the use of PROZAC in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. Animal Data Significant toxicity on muscle tissue, neurobehavior, reproductive organs, and bone development has been observed following exposure of juvenile rats to fluoxetine from weaning through maturity. When animals were evaluated after a drug-free period up to 11 weeks after cessation of dosing , fluoxetine was associated with neurobehavioral abnormalities decreased reactivity at AUC as low as approximately 0.</p>
<p>In addition, the testicular and epididymal microscopic lesions and decreased sperm concentrations found in high dose group were also observed, indicating that the drug effects on reproductive organs are irreversible. The reversibility of fluoxetine-induced muscle damage was not assessed. These fluoxetine toxicities in juvenile rats have not been observed in adult animals. Rat exposures to the major metabolite, norfluoxetine, are approximately 0. A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine by the intraperitoneal route to 4 week old mice for 4 weeks at doses 0.</p>
<p>A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine by the intraperitoneal route to 4 week old mice for 4 weeks at doses 0. There was a decrease in bone mineralization and density at both doses, but the overall growth body weight gain or femur length was not affected. Safety and efficacy of PROZAC and olanzapine in combination in patients 10 to 17 years of age have been established for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder.</p>
<p>Safety and effectiveness of PROZAC and olanzapine in combination in patients less than 10 years of age have not been established. For pharmacokinetic information in geriatric patients, [see Clinical Pharmacology  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions 5. Hepatic Impairment In subjects with cirrhosis of the liver, the clearances of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, were decreased, thus increasing the elimination half-lives of these substances.</p>
<p>A lower or less frequent dose of fluoxetine should be used in patients with cirrhosis. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of PROZAC e. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal overdosage were seizures, somnolence, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. Animal Experience Studies in animals do not provide precise or necessarily valid information about the treatment of human overdose.</p>
<p>However, animal experiments can provide useful insights into possible treatment strategies. Acute high oral doses produced hyperirritability and convulsions in several animal species.</p>
<p>Seizures stopped immediately upon the bolus intravenous administration of a standard veterinary dose of diazepam. Tachycardia and an increase in blood pressure were observed.</p>
<p>Consequently, the value of the ECG in predicting cardiac toxicity is unknown. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multi-drug overdose. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs.</p>
<p>Use general supportive and symptomatic measures. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for fluoxetine are known.</p>
<p>A specific caution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken fluoxetine and might ingest excessive quantities of a TCA. For specific information about overdosage with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, refer to the Overdosage section of the Symbyax package insert. The structural formula is: The Pulvules also contain starch, gelatin, silicone, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, and other inactive ingredients.</p>
<p>Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. Studies in animals also suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent uptake inhibitor of serotonin than of norepinephrine. Thus, fluoxetine may be administered with or without food. The interaction between fluoxetine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated, but may be important. In animal models, both enantiomers are specific and potent serotonin uptake inhibitors with essentially equivalent pharmacologic activity.</p>
<p>The S-fluoxetine enantiomer is eliminated more slowly and is the predominant enantiomer present in plasma at steady state. Metabolism — Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine and a number of other unidentified metabolites. The only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by demethylation of fluoxetine.</p>
<p>In animal models, S-norfluoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake and has activity essentially equivalent to R- or S-fluoxetine. R-norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake. John's wort, kava kava, valerian -tramadol -tryptophan -vinblastine This list may not describe all possible interactions.</p>
<p>Give your health care provider a list of all the medicines, herbs, non-prescription drugs, or dietary supplements you use. Also tell them if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs.</p>
<p>Some items may interact with your medicine. What should I watch for while using this medicine? Tell your doctor if your symptoms do not get better or if they get worse. Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your progress. Patients and their families should watch out for new or worsening thoughts of suicide or depression.</p></p>
