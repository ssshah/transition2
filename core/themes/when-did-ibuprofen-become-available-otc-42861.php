		<p><p>And as Dr Adams himself discovered on a trip to Afghanistan in the s, even remote village pharmacies along the Khyber Pass were selling his wonder drug. But, he says modestly, the discovery didn't change his life at all. Search for a challenge It all started with a year-old boy from Northamptonshire, who'd left school with no clear plan for his future. He started an apprenticeship in retail pharmacy at Boots and the experience whetted Stewart Adams' appetite for a more challenging career.</p>
<p>His mission at that time was to find a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis which was as effective as a steroid but without any of the side-effects. Image copyright BOOTS UK Image caption Dr Stewart Adams spent his whole career at Boots UK, researching and developing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs He started looking at anti-inflammatories and, in particular, the way aspirin worked, which no-one else appeared to be doing.</p>
<p>Aspirin was the first non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to be developed, in  It seems to be more effective for postsurgical dental pain and soft-tissue injuries, but cannot be taken by people with certain conditions, such as an allergy to aspirin. A report in the May issue of Medical Sciences Bulletin detailed a new medical application for ibuprofen. Research has revealed that high doses of ibuprofen slow lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>At high doses the drug inhibits release of lysosomal enzymes and the migration, adherence, swelling, and aggregation of neutrophils white blood cells. Researchers believe that ibuprofen may prolong survival among cystic fibrosis patients with mild lung disease. The vote was  Based on the committee's conclusion, the FDA may change the advice about the drug's safety that it provides to doctors.</p>
<p>The FDA doesn't have to follow the advice of advisory committees advice but usually does. The availability and safety of alternatives to opioid painkillers have become increasingly important as the nation grapples with the deadly epidemic.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, some doctors have been reluctant to prescribe celecoxib, which isn't an opioid, because it is similar to Vioxx , a pain reliever that was withdrawn from the market in because of safety concerns.</p>
<p>Both drugs are known as COX-2 inhibitors because they act by blocking an enzyme involved in inflammation. After Vioxx was launched in , it quickly became a blockbuster and was used by millions of people. PGH2, in turn, is converted by other enzymes to several other prostaglandins which are mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever and to thromboxane A2 which stimulates platelet aggregation, leading to the formation of blood clots.</p>
<p>The analgesic , antipyretic , and anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs appears to operate mainly through inhibition of COX-2, which decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.</p>
<p>Inhibition of COX-1 instead would be responsible for unwanted effects on the gastrointestinal tract. The R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer in vivo. The S-enantiomer is believed to be the more pharmacologically active enantiomer.</p>
<p>Virtually all of these have no pharmacological effects. The synthesis took six steps. Avoid the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If ibuprofen tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p>
<p>Hypertension NSAIDs including ibuprofen tablets can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Use of Ibuprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.</p>
<p>Avoid the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure.</p>
<p>If ibuprofen tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets can cause serious gastrointestinal GI adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy.</p>
<p>However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status.</p>
<p>Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with a NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.</p>
<p>Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion.</p>
<p>In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Advanced Renal Disease No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease.</p>
<p>Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen tablets therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable.</p>
<p>Anaphylactoid Reactions As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ibuprofen tablets. Ibuprofen tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</p>
<p>These serious events may occur without warning.</p></p>
