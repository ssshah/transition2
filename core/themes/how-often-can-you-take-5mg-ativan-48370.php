		<p><p>God bless" nat taken for 6 months to 1 year July 16, 3 users found this comment helpful. Doc prescribed it to me after experiencing a full-blown panic attack that didn't seem to subside.</p>
<p>I felt immediate relief after months of experiencing depression and anxiety attacks. Over the years, I became dependent on it I take times a week I never take it for more than two days in a row because of a bad reaction that I had like 13 years ago. Because I take it so sparingly, I have not developed tolerance , but I am dependent on this medication for my agoraphobia and panic attacks. This drug allowed me to go outside and socialize, make new friends, and hold down a job.</p>
<p>This job allowed me to live! I don't want to become dependent on it, so I started tapering. My goal to go off this drug completely and use it only for emergencies. I take it as needed, usually 1mg every three days at night. Sleep like a baby and wake up the next morning energised and ready to start the day.</p>
<p>Only worry is the possible addictive qualities. I also take small dose Cymbalta 30mg, each morning. It has been a huge help. In addition, it is a mood stabilizer in that I rarely get nervous or out of control in pressure situations. I do worry about addiction because I have never gone off it.</p>
<p>When it's needed, I'm very thankful to have this drug. I find it very helpful in knocking back my anxiety so that I can think again and gain some space. It has a sedative effect, but it's not overwhelming to the point where I would fear falling asleep while driving, etc.</p>
<p>Definitely better than facing the whirlwind without it. After a number of physically demanding tests and a second opinion, I started chemo treatments. Experienced a sensation in my throat that I mistaken thought was nausea but was later determined to be anxiety. I usually just take one pill at night when the sensation starts but have takes 3 pills 8 hrs. I am usually adverse to taking pills but will try anything on those really bad days after chemo. I've been told average life expectancy for my cancer is 30 months give or take.</p>
<p>I hope this med will increase the quality of life I have left. I was scared to be out in public, but I did work at a nursing home for over 20 years, and I wouldnt change that.</p>
<p>But as I aged I kept getting worse, my depression and anxiety, Now with my lorazapam, and yes it has been long term, but I can live, some people may not understand it, but I do mean LIVE. Felt like killing myself I do suffer from symtomatic diverticulosis. Lorazepam is a medication that is used to treat anxiety, sleep disorders, and seizures.
