<p>These drops protect against infection, decrease inflammation, and keep you comfortable. They are intended to help decrease the chance of infection…inside the eye. Interestingly, there are no studies showing that antibiotic eye drops decrease the infection rate. This is because the chance of getting an infection inside your eye following cataract surgery are very low, about one out of every 1, people nations wide. In my hands, it has been even rarer.</p></p>
