		<p><p>Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis , diarrhea, or vomiting.</p>
<p>In patients with congestive heart failure , with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria , azotemia , and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, start amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride therapy under close medical supervision; follow closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of the benazepril component is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased.</p>
<p>Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis. If hypotension occurs, place the patient in a supine position, and if necessary, treat with intravenous infusion of physiologic saline. Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Drugs that act on the renin angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when used in pregnancy. In several dozen published cases, ACE inhibitor use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia , anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death [see Use In Specific Populations].</p>
<p>Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and, sometimes, death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.</p>
<p>In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis , levels of benazeprilat are essentially unaltered. In a small study of hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis , treatment with benazepril was associated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of benazepril therapy, concomitant diuretic therapy, or both.</p>
<p>When such patients are treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride, monitor renal function during the first few weeks of therapy. Some benazepril-treated hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when benazepril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic.</p>
<p>Dosage reduction of amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride may be required. Renal function should be monitored periodically in patients receiving benazepril. Increases in serum potassium were generally reversible. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically in patients receiving benazepril.</p>
<p>Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy.</p>
<p>Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.</p>
<p>Patient Counseling Information Pregnancy Tell female patients of childbearing age that use of drugs like benazepril that act on the renin-angiotensin system can cause serious problems in the fetus and infant including: Discuss other treatment options with female patients planning to become pregnant.</p>
<p>Tell women using amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride who become pregnant to notify their physicians as soon as possible. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with this combination.</p>
