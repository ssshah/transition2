		<p><p>Antacids also may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. If patients are receiving iron salts or antacids and ciprofloxacin, the ciprofloxacin should be given two hours before or six hours after the iron salt or antacid. Ciprofloxacin may increase the blood thinning effect of warfarin Coumadin , Jantoven.</p>
<p>The reason for this is unknown. Anticoagulant activity should be monitored after starting or stopping ciprofloxacin. Sevelamer Renagel may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin and possibly reduce the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin.</p>
<p>Milk and orange juice also may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin, as with iron and antacids, should be given two hours before or six hours after milk or orange juice. Administration of ciprofloxacin with diabetic medications for example glyburide [Micronase, Diabeta, Glynase, Prestab] may lead to severe low blood glucose. An investigation was directed to assess the efficacy of cephalexin treatment in patients with infectious sinusitis source.</p>
<p>Sixty-nine patients met all criteria for assessment. Patients returned for observation about one week and two weeks subsequent to starting treatment. Results demonstrated that cephalexin was powerful in treating sinusitis and that negative reactions were uncommon.</p>
<p>Bacteriology results demonstrated that huge numbers of the pathogens generally responsible for infectious sinusitis were resistant to most antibiotics prescribed. These same pathogens, in any case, were submissive to cephalexin. Thus, Cephalexin is clinically tested to be one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of sinus infection. Use them sparingly as needed. Don 4 people found this useful How do you get a sinus infection?</p>
<p>Sinus infections usually occur when sinuses become blocked, making the warm, moist, mucus-filled sinus cavity a perfect medium in which viruses or bacteria can grow. These conditions may cause inflammation in the sinus cavity and prevent sinuses from draining properly. This blockage can potentially lead to congestion and infection.</p>
<p>Can you have a sinus headache without a sinus infection? Headache With No Infection. An occasional sinus headache may come on with the changes in weather. Often taking an over the counter sinus medication, or one antihistimine and one acetametaphin will stop the headache.</p>
<p>If the headache is unbearable, however, it would be best to check in with your doctor. Can you smell your own sinus infection? Believe it or not yes you can at times depending on how bad the infection is. Can you take amoxicillin for a sinus infection?</p>
<p>I was just looking to see what antibiotics I could take for a sinus infection. I read 2 articles that said that amoxicillin was appropriate, but that doctors rarely prescribe them until after a week or so of severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Are sinus infections contagious? It is not supposed to be contagious but everyone must be careful. How do you draw out a sinus infection? Well I sympathize with you for having a sinus infection, not a nice thing to have at all. There are many remedies to combat sinus infections such as Hepar Sulph it is used to treat the discharge of thick, green mucus that's associated with sinus infections.</p>
<p>Pulsatilla is good for the pain and Silica is good if it is allergy associated. So as you can see a little more info would be needed to give a correct remedy. But if you dont have the money to go and see a homeopath, Hepar Sulph would be a good place to start. Can a sinus infection be contagious? No a sinus infection can not be contagious just like allergies are not contagious. But if some organism eats your mucus it is possible for that organism to get your cold or flu.</p>
<p>Which is better for tooth infection keflex or amoxicillin? I asked my dentist this very question and was prescribed keflex which cephalexin. Can you go swimming with a sinus infection? Swimming with sinus infections won't make it worse but it might cause your ears a short amount of irritation. Does Keflex treat bacterial infections? A semisynthetic analog of cephalosporin, it attacks Gram negative bacteria. It's used frequently for upper respiratory and urinary tract infections, but also has wide spectrum applications.</p>
<p>What to do for sinus infections? Well, first of all, you need to go to a doctor to actually get it diagnosed. Once it's been diagnosed, the doctor will either have you wait for a week and care for it at home to see if it'll go away on its own, or they will put you on an antibiotic. Usually, you'd take the Amoxicillin for days, but sometimes an extension to 21 days is recommended. If the Amoxicillin doesn't work, they may switch you to a more potent antibiotic.</p>
<p>One thing you can do to avoid sinus infections is to stay away from dry climates. If, like me, you live in a desert, then having a humidifier in your house may help.</p>
<p>I use one in my bedroom at night and it seems to help a lot. Good luck with your sinus infection! Will cephalexin treat a sinus infection? The sphenoid sinuses are more deeply recessed, and sinusitis there can manifest with vague symptoms of earaches, neck pain, and deep aching at the top of the head.</p>
<p>However, in most patients with a suspected diagnosis of sinusitis, pain or tenderness is found in several locations, and the perceived area of pain usually does not clearly delineate which sinuses are inflamed. Purulent drainage may be evident on examination as anterior rhinorrhea or visualized as posterior pharyngeal drainage with associated clinical symptoms of sore throat and cough.</p>
<p>The nose should be examined for a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps, and epistaxis. Foreign bodies and tumors can mimic symptoms of sinusitis and should be in the differential diagnosis, especially if the symptoms are unilateral.</p>
<p>The ears should be examined for signs of associated otitis media and the chest for the presence of asthma exacerbation, a common comorbid condition. Back to Top Diagnosis In a primary care setting, a good history and physical examination to detect the presence of most or all of the commonly manifesting signs and symptoms can provide a reliable diagnosis of acute sinusitis.</p>
<p>The presence of purulent secretions has the highest positive predictive value for diagnosing sinusitis clinically. Differentiating it from a common viral URTI is most important. Mucus in URTIs is typically not described as persistently purulent. Nasal congestion is a predominant symptom without persistent or worsening head congestion, headache, or facial pain or fatigue.</p>
<p>URTI symptoms would be expected to peak on about day 3 to 5 and resolve within 7 to 10 days. Most other diagnostic modalities, described later, aid in the differential diagnosis of persistent nasal symptoms.</p>
<p>Radiographic Evaluation The two modalities most commonly used include the plain radiograph and CT scan. Plain radiography does not adequately represent the individual ethmoid air cells, the extent of mucosal thickening in chronic sinusitis, or visualization of the ostiomeatal complex.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging can be considered for evaluation of suspected tumors but is not recommended for acute sinusitis because it does not distinguish air from bone. For these reasons, CT scanning of the sinuses is the imaging procedure of choice Fig.</p>
<p>In many centers, the cost is similar to that of plain radiographs because of the availability of limited coronal views usually comprising approximately six coronal views of the maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses that are optimally sufficient for ruling out sinusitis.</p>
<p>More detailed coronal slices are useful for viewing the ostiomeatal complex and for surgical mapping. Click to Enlarge Transillumination A common practice before plain radiographs and CT scans were widely available, transillumination is of limited use and ahs a high rate of error.</p>
<p>Ultrasonography Ultrasonography has not been proved accurate enough to substitute for a radiographic evaluation. However, it may be considered to confirm sinusitis in pregnant women, for whom radiographic studies could pose a risk.</p>
<p>Nasal Smear By examining the cellular contents of the nasal secretions, one might find polymorphonuclear cells and bacteria in sinusitis. In a viral infection, these would not be found, and in allergic disease, one would expect to find eosinophils. Sinus Puncture The most accurate way to determine the causative organism in sinusitis is a sinus puncture. After anesthetization of the puncture site, usually in the canine fossa or inferior meatus, the contents of the maxillary sinus are aspirated under sterile technique, and bacterial cultures are performed to identify the organism.</p>
<p>Culture specimens obtained from nasal swabs correlate poorly with sinus pathogens found by puncture because of contamination of the swab with normal nasal flora.</p>
<p>However, because sinus puncture is an invasive procedure, it is not routinely performed. More recently, studies have shown a close correlation between organisms found by sinus puncture and by endoscopically guided aspiration of the sinus cavities through the middle meatus. Although this needs to be done by an otolaryngologist trained in the procedure, it may be necessary for defining the pathogenic organism when standard therapy has failed or in an immunocompromised patient who is at high risk for sequelae of untreated sinusitis, such as orbital or central nervous system complications.</p></p>
