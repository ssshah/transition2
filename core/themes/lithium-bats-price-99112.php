		<p><p>The success of your investment will depend on the sustained popularity of mobile devices and the increased popularity of electric cars. All these devices need Li-ion batteries, and as such the demand for the metal will skyrocket. Aside from various uncommon usages, lithium is used mainly as a component of rechargeable Li-ion batteries and as a treatment for several types of mental disorders.</p>
<p>Its use in Li-ion batteries is perhaps its most common and most important use today. You can also find this element in non-rechargeable batteries, which provide power for clocks, heart pacemakers, and various toys. It acts on the nervous system, and it can modify your actions and behavior.</p>
<p>It is also used as an alloy mixed with aluminum, so that it can strengthen aircraft. This alloy can also be used for high-speed trains and high-quality bicycle frames. Alloyed with magnesium, it is used to make armor plating. More from Features Market Brief Lithium is the lightest known metal but its consumption in the form of non-metallic products like lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide are core to a number of end markets such as batteries, ceramics, glass and industrial grease.</p>
<p>Over the last three years, lithium has come to the attention of the mainstream media and financial institutions owing to is critical role in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries — the batteries that have been chosen to power the next generation of electric vehicles. Lithium carbonate is the key raw material for battery manufacturing and the production of which has been the focus of a flood of explorers that have come onto the scene in recent years.</p>
<p>It is produced from continental brines predominately in South America, and the hard rock minerals pegmatite and spodumene mainly in Australia. There are two very different ways of extracting lithium 1. Brine is pumped from subsurface reservoirs to surface ponds. The power of the sun evaporates excess water and concentrates the mineral content of the brine.</p>
<p>Hard rock is mining in the more traditional sense. Spodumene is mined and crushed to form a concentrate. This mineral concentrate is then sold to chemical companies which use the feedstock to produce lithium chemicals or to glass and ceramics producers which use it as an additive.</p>
<p>At present, no hard rock lithium miner produces downstream chemicals. Other sources of lithium being developed or explored are: Now, however, it looks set to scale even greater heights as carmakers, led by Tesla, step up efforts to mass produce electric vehicles using an enhanced version of that same technology.</p>
<p>Lithium could become the key material in the coming green revolution of storable energy. But the lightest of metals in the periodic table is shrouded in darkness when it comes to its pricing mechanics. If lithium is going to become an integral part of the global energy supply chain, its market opacity is a big problem. Start with the most basic of questions. What is the price of lithium? Whichever measure you use, prices are on the up.</p>
<p>Macquarie, meanwhile, notes that Chinese import prices for Chinese carbonate and export prices for hydroxide have hit record highs. There are two problems here. The first is the bewildering number of products that can be made from lithium, ranging from lithium stearate industrial grease to lithium fluoride aluminum smelting to butyllithium organic compounds.</p>
<p>All are normally converted for pricing into lithium carbonate, largely used for battery manufacture.</p></p>
