<p>All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias and we judged them to be at moderate risk of bias overall. No study reported data on PGIC. A greater proportion of participants on quetiapine reported a clinically relevant improvement of health-related quality of life compared to placebo RD 0. Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing sleep problems standardised mean difference SMD  Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing the risk of withdrawing from the study due to a lack of efficacy RD  There was no statistically significant difference between quetiapine and placebo in the proportion of participants withdrawing due to adverse events tolerability very low quality evidence , in the frequency of serious adverse events safety very low quality evidence and in the proportion of participants reporting dizziness and somnolence as an adverse event very low quality evidence.</p>
<p>In more participants in the quetiapine group a substantial weight gain was noted RD 0. We downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels to a very low quality rating because of limitations of study design, indirectness patients with major medical diseases and mental disorders were excluded and imprecision fewer than patients were analysed. The study had three major risks of bias and we judged it to be at moderate risk of bias overall.</p>

If you or a loved one live with fibromyalgia, then you are no stranger to the litany of symptoms that plague us. And finding relief from the pain is only one of the challenges we face. All of us deal with seemingly random and disconnected symptoms. For now, though, we also have to deal with chronic fatigue, memory and cognition problems, mood issues, and the one that makes it all worse: Any one of these symptoms is enough by itself, but combine any or all of them, and it just feels like your life is slipping away.</p>
<p>So if you have found a good physician to help treat your fibro symptoms, it is probably no surprise if she suggested a prescription antidepressant. Most of these uses are "off-label", but that doesn't seem to be a hindrance to medical professionals. I've had 3 doctors tell me that they "like seroquel, it's a good drug.

<p>Celexa is aused with many people with PTSD, used to help with anxiety and depression, and if your doctor feels the need to not give you ambien for whatever reason, he might proscribe trazadone or seroquel for sleep.</p>

Imagine pain all over, shooting up and down, headaches, pins and needles and memory loss on a daily basis without an explanation apart from 'fibromyalgia' which is incurable. Not oodles of fun mate. Can fibromyalgia be prevented?</p>
<p>There is no known or specific prevention for fibromyalgia. However, similar to many other medical conditions, remaining as healthy as possible with a good diet, safe exercise, and adequate rest is the best prevention.</p>

I cried a lot when I wasa baby I believe because I was in pain and my mother had a lot oftrouble getting me to sleep compared to the trouble she had withall my brothers and sisters disordered sleep right from thestart. I kept on bringing up food and was very colicky, and I didnot like being touched even as a small child, because it hurt somuch.</p>
<p>I have always had trouble sleeping and have always had reallybad, unexplainable pains. I was always getting sick with pneumoniaand the flu, but many times I was sick with no observable cause - Icouldn't go to school often but the doctors couldn't figure outwhat was wrong with me.</p>
