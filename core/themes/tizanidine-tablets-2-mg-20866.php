		<p><p>Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of Tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely to occur in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods, or with concomitant use of narcotics.</p>
<p>If therapy needs to be discontinued, the dose should be decreased slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms [ see Dosage and Administration 2. These transient withdrawal signs increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer were not reversed by naloxone administration. Overdosage A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental Tizanidine Tablets, USP overdose.</p>
<p>Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of Tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology. In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy, somnolence, confusion and coma.</p>
<p>Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension. Respiratory depression is another common feature of Tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid-soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol.</p>
<p>Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of Tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of Tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center.</p>
<p>Tizanidine HCl is a white to off-white, fine crystalline powder, which is odorless or with a faint characteristic odor. Tizanidine is slightly soluble in water and methanol; solubility in water decreases as the pH increases. Its chemical name is 5-chloro 2-imidazolinylamino -2,1,3-benzothiadiazole monohydrochloride. Tizanidine Tablets, USP are supplied as 2 mg and 4 mg tablets for oral administration.</p>
<p>Tizanidine - Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Tizanidine is a central alphaadrenergic receptor agonist and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The effects of Tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways.</p>
<p>The effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. Tizanidine is in the FDA pregnancy C. This means that it is not known whether Tizanidine will harm an unborn baby. Do not take this medication without first talking to your doctor if you are pregnant. It is not known whether Tizanidine passes into breast milk. Do not take Tizanidine without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: If you experience either of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: If you experience any of the following serious side effects, stop taking Sirdalud tizanidine and seek emergency medical attention: The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive.</p>
<p>Clinical Studies Tizanidine's capacity to reduce increased muscle tone associated with spasticity was demonstrated in two adequate and well controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury Studies 1 and 2. Single-Dose Study in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis with Spasticity In Study 1, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment e.</p>
<p>In all, patients received placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of Zanaflex. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale Ashworth score , with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone. A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult.</p>
<p>A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment. A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for Zanaflex compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment. Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg Zanaflex groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients.</p>
<p>Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations were variable from patient to patient at a given dose. Although 16 mg produced a larger effect, adverse events including hypotension were more common and more severe than in the 8 mg group.</p>
<p>There were no differences in the number of spasms occurring in each group. Steps similar to those taken in the first study were employed to ensure the integrity of blinding. Patients were titrated over 3 weeks up to a maximum tolerated dose or 36 mg daily given in three unequal doses e. Patients were then maintained on their maximally tolerated dose for 4 additional weeks i. Throughout the maintenance phase, muscle tone was assessed on the Ashworth scale within a period of 2.</p>
<p>The number of daytime spasms was recorded daily by patients. At endpoint the protocol-specified time of outcome assessment , there was a statistically significant reduction in muscle tone and frequency of spasms in the Zanaflex treated group compared to placebo.</p>
<p>The reduction in muscle tone was not associated with a reduction in muscle strength a desirable outcome but also did not lead to any consistent advantage of Zanaflex treated patients on measures of activities of daily living.</p>
<p>Figure 3 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. Instruct patients to inform their physicians or pharmacists when they start or stop taking any medication because of the risks associated with interaction between Zanaflex and other medicines.</p>
<p>Zanaflex Dosing Tell patients to take Zanaflex exactly as prescribed consistently either with or without food and not to switch between tablets and capsules. Inform patients that they should not take more Zanaflex than prescribed because of the risk of adverse events at single doses greater than 8 mg or total daily doses greater than 36 mg. Tell patients that they should not suddenly discontinue Zanaflex, because rebound hypertension and tachycardia may occur. In animal models, tizanidine has no direct effect on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and no major effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes.</p>
<p>The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons. Pharmacokinetics A single dose of two 4 mg tablets was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of the tablet in the fasted state , tizanidine has peak plasma concentrations occurring 1 hour after dosing with a half-life of approximately 2 hours.</p>
<p>Food also increases the extent of absorption of the tablet. Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of 6 mg tizanidine showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects.</p>
<p>Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine.</p>
<p>In one study, patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to receive single oral doses of drug or placebo. Patients and assessors were blind to treatment assignment and efforts were made to reduce the likelihood that assessors would become aware indirectly of treatment assignment e. In all, patients received either placebo, 8 mg or 16 mg of tizanidine. Response was assessed by physical examination; muscle tone was rated on a 5 point scale Ashworth score , with a score of 0 used to describe normal muscle tone.</p>
<p>A score of 1 indicated a slight spastic catch while a score of 2 indicated more marked muscle resistance. A score of 3 was used to describe considerable increase in tone, making passive movement difficult. A muscle immobilized by spasticity was given a score of 4. Spasm counts were also collected. Assessments were made at 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours after treatment.</p>
<p>A statistically significant reduction of the Ashworth score for tizanidine compared to placebo was detected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after treatment.</p>
<p>Figure 2 below shows a comparison of the mean change in muscle tone from baseline as measured by the Ashworth scale. The greatest reduction in muscle tone was 1 to 2 hours after treatment. By 6 hours after treatment, muscle tone in the 8 and 16 mg tizanidine groups was indistinguishable from muscle tone in placebo treated patients.</p>
<p>Within a given patient, improvement in muscle tone was correlated with plasma concentration.</p></p>
