		<p><p>Drug And Food Interactions Advise patients that many drugs or other substances may interact with colchicine capsules and some interactions could be fatal. Therefore, patients should report to their healthcare provider all of the current medications they are taking, and check with their healthcare provider before starting any new medications, including short-term medications such as antibiotics. Patients should also be advised to report the use of non-prescription medication or herbal products.</p>
<p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may also interact and should not be consumed during treatment with colchicine capsules. Neuromuscular Toxicity Advise patients that muscle pain or weakness, tingling or numbness in fingers or toes may occur with colchicine capsules alone or when it is used with certain other drugs.</p>
<p>Patients developing any of these signs or symptoms must discontinue colchicine capsules and seek medical evaluation immediately. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies of colchicine have not been conducted.</p>
<p>Due to the potential for colchicine to produce aneuploid cells cells with an unequal number of chromosomes , colchicine presents a theoretical increased risk of malignancy. Mutagenesis Published studies demonstrated that colchicine was negative for mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation assay.</p>
<p>However, in vitro chromosomal aberration assays demonstrated the formation of micronuclei following colchicine treatment. Because published studies demonstrated that colchicine induces aneuploidy through the process of mitotic nondisjunction without structural DNA changes, colchicine is not considered clastogenic, although micronuclei are formed.</p>
<p>Impairment Of Fertility There were no studies of the effects of colchicine capsules on fertility. However, published nonclinical studies have demonstrated that colchicine-induced disruption of microtubule formation affects meiosis and mitosis. Published reproductive studies with colchicine reported abnormal sperm morphology and reduced sperm counts in males, and interference with sperm penetration, second meiotic division, and normal cleavage in females.</p>
<p>Case reports and epidemiology studies in human male subjects on colchicine therapy indicate that infertility from colchicine is rare. A case report indicated that azoospermia was reversed when therapy was stopped. Case reports and epidemiology studies in female subjects on colchicine therapy have not established a clear relationship between colchicine use and female infertility.</p>
<p>Colchicine crosses the human placenta. Developmental studies in animals were not conducted with colchicine capsules, however published animal reproduction and development studies with colchicine demonstrated embryofetal toxicity, teratogenicity, and altered postnatal development at exposures within or above the clinical therapeutic range. Colchicine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Labor And Delivery The effect of colchicine on labor and delivery is unknown. Use In Nursing Mothers Colchicine is excreted into human milk. Limited information suggests that infants exclusively breastfed receive less than 10 percent of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. While there are no published reports of adverse effects in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking colchicine, colchicine can affect gastrointestinal cell renewal and permeability.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised and breastfeeding infants should be observed for adverse effects when colchicine capsules is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Gout is rare in pediatric patients; the safety and effectiveness of colchicine capsules in pediatric patients has not been evaluated in controlled studies. Geriatric Use Because of the increased incidence of decreased renal function in the elderly population, and the higher incidence of other co-morbid conditions in the elderly population requiring the use of other medications, reducing the dosage of colchicine when elderly patients are treated with colchicine should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Renal Impairment No dedicated pharmacokinetic study has been conducted using colchicine capsules in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment.</p>
<p>Colchicine is known to be excreted in urine in humans and the presence of severe renal impairment has been associated with colchicine toxicity. Urinary clearance of colchicine and its metabolites may be decreased in patients with impaired renal function. Dose reduction or alternatives should be considered for the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with severe renal impairment. Colchicine is not effectively removed by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Patients who are undergoing hemodialysis should be monitored carefully for colchicine toxicity. Hepatic Impairment No dedicated pharmacokinetic study using colchicine capsules has been conducted in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.</p>
<p>Your dose will depend on the reason you are taking this medication. Colchicine doses for gout and Mediterranean fever are different. If you use this medication over a long period of time, your blood may need to be tested on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Do not miss any scheduled appointments. Keep using colchicine as directed, even if you feel well. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in preventing gout attacks. Do not stop using colchicine without first talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use. What happens if I miss a dose Colcrys? When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, the uric acid may form hard crystals in your joints.</p>
<p>Colchicine works by decreasing swelling and lessening the build up of uric acid crystals that cause pain in the affected joint s. This medication is also used to prevent attacks of pain in the abdomen , chest, or joints caused by a certain inherited disease familial Mediterranean fever. It is thought to work by decreasing your body's production of a certain protein amyloid A that builds up in people with familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine is not a pain medication and should not be used to relieve other causes of pain.</p>
<p>How to use Colchicine Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking colchicine and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions regarding the information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Take this medication by mouth with or without food, exactly as directed by your doctor. Treatment of Gout Flares For treatment of gout flares in patients with mild to moderate hepatic function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, for the treatment of gout flares in patients with severe impairment, while the dose does not need to be adjusted, a treatment course should be repeated no more than once every two weeks.</p>
<p>For these patients, requiring repeated courses for the treatment of gout flares, consideration should be given to alternate therapy [see Hepatic Impairment 8. FMF Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine.</p>
<p>Dose reduction should be considered in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Hepatic Impairment 8. Further information Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances.</p></p>

Hepatic clearance of colchicine may be significantly reduced and plasma half-life prolonged in patients with chronic hepatic impairment.

The first stage of acute colchicine toxicity typically begins within 24 hours of ingestion and includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal painnausea, vomiting, <i>colchicine 0.6 mg dose</i>, diarrhea and significant fluid loss, leading to volume depletion. The recommended dose is 1. Caution should be exercised and breastfeeding infants should be observed for adverse effects when colchicine capsules is administered to a nursing woman.
