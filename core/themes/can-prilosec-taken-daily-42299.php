		<p><p>Prilosec OTC omeprazole is used for the treatment of acid reflux. It is in the family of proton pump inhibitors that work by disabling some of the acid producing pumps in the stomach to help relieve the symptoms of acid reflux. The prescribing information on Prilosec OTC states that you should not split the caplet in half because it uses an enteric coating to delay the release of medication until it reaches the small intestine, where it will not be destroyed by the stomach acids.</p>
<p>If you break the caplet the coating will not work and this will cause the medication to be ineffective. For more information on Prilosec OTC, click on this link: Lori Poulin, PharmD Q: My mom seems to be having adverse reactions palpitations, light headedness, dizziness, nausea to generic prilosec.</p>
<p>Is it possible to react differently to generics by different manufacturers? Generic drugs are lower-cost alternatives to more expensive brand-name drugs.</p>
<p>They will appear different and have a few other minor differences from the brand-name drugs, but their labeling and directions for use must be virtually the same as that of the brand name product. Both brand-name and generic drug manufacturing facilities must follow the same standards of good manufacturing practices and meet the U.</p>
<p>Food and Drug Administration Q: Does Prilosec OTC cause gas, bloating, and constipation? Prilosec may also be used short term to treat ulcers. A search of prescribing information did list gas and constipation as side effects of Prilosec OTC. This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with Prilosec OTC. Kimberly Hotz, PharmD Q: I have been on it for almost 2 months. A review of medical literature found case reports of night sweats in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p>
<p>For more information, please consult with your health care provider and visit: You are encouraged to report any negative side effects of prescription drugs to your health care practitioner and the U. I suffer from excessive belching. Could this be because of the Prilosec I take every day, which my doctor has prescribed? It's also used for the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions.</p>
<p>In clinical studies, the most common side effects reported with Prilosec include headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, gas, and diarrhea.</p>
<p>This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with Prilosec. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action.</p>
<p>Other causes of bloating and gas pains include the following: Adopting certain lifestyle modifications can help alleviate bloating and gas symptoms. Try to chew food slowly; avoid drinking from a straw; avoid chewing gum or sucking on hard candy; avoid foods that are difficult to digest, such as cabbage, brussel sprouts, grapes, beans, or lentils; avoid foods, beverages, and candy containing sorbitol and fructose; avoid foods, beverages, medications, dietary supplements, and nutritional supplements containing the milk protein lactose if you are lactose intolerant; and don't smoke.</p>
<p>I have read recently that Prilosec is not good to be taken on a regular basis. Is it safe to take occasionally? I know years ago there was a correlation between Prilosec and cancer. Now they are talking about it again.</p>
<p>Prilosec omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor PPI used to treat ulcers, heartburn, and gastric reflux. Prilosec is now available over the counter. Patients who take Prilosec over the counter should not take it for longer than two weeks consistently without consulting their health care provider. This is due to the fact that if you have symptoms that last longer than two weeks, you may have a more serious condition that would need to be evaluated and treated by a physician.</p>
<p>Long-term use of PPIs is generally considered safe under the direction of a doctor. There is some talk that long term use of PPI's could cause some problems, such as decreased immunity and osteoporosis, but this is yet to be proven. It is always best to avoid taking medication you do not need, but occasional use of Prilosec is likely to be safe, and long term use under the direction of a physician would also likely be safe for most patients.</p>
<p>Please see the following Everyday Health link for more information on Prilosec. Laura Cable, PharmD Q: What are the long term effects of using drugs like Prilosec for acid reflux? I have to take it every day. PPIs proton pump inhibitors , such as Prilosec omeprazole , Prevacid lansoprazole , Nexium esomeprazole , Protonix pantoprazole , and Aciphex rabeprazole , were initially created to help treat ulcers in the GI gastrointestinal tract over a few weeks, and they are used for GERD gastroesophageal reflux disease , and other acid related conditions.</p>
<p>However, many doctors have authorized their patients to keep taking them past the initial set timeframes, and in general, they are still considered to be safe.</p>
<p>Complications can occur while taking any medications, and this is also the case with PPIs. The body makes stomach acid to digest food and the acidic environment can also prevent bacteria from growing.</p>
<p>When a PPI, such as Prilosec omeprazole is used over the longterm, an abundance of gastrin, an important stomach hormone, can cause a rebound effect of extra large stomach acid secretion if the PPI is stopped. The PPIs can interfere with the processing of the blood thinner Plavix clopidogrel , which may not thin the blood enough, with vitamin B cyanocobalamin and calcium, as they need the acidic environment to be absorbed.</p>
<p>Common triggers such as fatty or fried foods, alcohol, chocolate, peppermint, garlic, onion, caffeine and nicotine may make heartburn worse. Avoid stooping or bending. Tying your shoes is OK. Bending over for longer periods to weed your garden isn't, especially soon after eating. Don't lie down after a meal. Thank you so much. I've recently been through a lot of stress and took up some bad habits, like smoking and heavy drinking.</p>
<p>I've quit smoking and really cut down on my alcohol intake. I take Prilosec once, sometimes twice a day. I've been taking it for about 6 months now. I've had tests done, but they all came up empty. I'm pretty sure I have an ulcer, though. The Prilosec works great, but I also have to watch what I eat and when.</p>
<p>Beer, wine, hard liquor, and all that stuff really rips my gut up. I hope there aren't huge long term side effects because I plan to take Prilosec twice a day for the next 6 months to let my ulcer heal. I'm also going to stop drinking completely no more of this "just one drink a week or month" crap because it's not working. The Prilosec keeps the dull ache I get at bay. Pancreatitis some fatal , anorexia , irritable colon , fecal discoloration, esophageal candidiasis , mucosal atrophy of the tongue, stomatitis, abdominal swelling, dry mouth , microscopic colitis.</p>
<p>During treatment with omeprazole, gastric fundic gland polyps have been noted rarely. These polyps are benign and appear to be reversible when treatment is discontinued. This finding is believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors. Liver disease including hepatic failure some fatal , liver necrosis some fatal , hepatic encephalopathy hepatocellular disease, cholestatic disease, mixed hepatitis , jaundice , and elevations of liver function tests [ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin] Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Metabolism and Nutritional disorders: Psychiatric and sleep disturbances including depression, agitation, aggression, hallucinations, confusion, insomnia, nervousness, apathy, somnolence , anxiety, and dream abnormalities; tremors, paresthesia ; vertigo Skin: Severe generalized skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis some fatal , Stevens-Johnson syndrome , and erythema multiforme; photosensitivity ; urticaria; rash; skin inflammation; pruritus ; petechiae ; purpura ; alopecia ; dry skin; hyperhidrosis Special Senses: Tinnitus , taste perversion Ocular: Optic atrophy, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy , optic neuritis, dry eye syndrome, ocular irritation, blurred vision, double vision Urogenital: Co-administration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect and the development of drug resistance.</p>
<p>Co-administration of saquinavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to increase saquinavir concentrations, which may increase toxicity and require dose reduction. Omeprazole has been reported to interact with some antiretroviral drugs.</p>
<p>The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. Increased gastric pH during omeprazole treatment may change the absorption of the antiretroviral drug. Other possible interaction mechanisms are via CYP2C Reduced Concentrations Of Atazanavir And Nelfinavir For some antiretroviral drugs, such as atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with omeprazole.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration with omeprazole and drugs such as atazanavir and nelfinavir is therefore not recommended. Dose reduction of saquinavir should be considered from the safety perspective for individual patients. There are also some antiretroviral drugs of which unchanged serum levels have been reported when given with omeprazole.</p>
<p>Drugs For Which Gastric pH Can Affect Bioavailability Due to its effects on gastric acid secretion, omeprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability.</p>
<p>Like with other drugs that decrease the intragastric acidity, the absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, iron salts, erlotinib, and mycophenolate mofetil MMF can decrease, while the absorption of drugs such as digoxin can increase during treatment with omeprazole. Co-administration of omeprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid MPA , possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.</p>
<p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse. Some conditions are treated with a combination of omeprazole and antibiotics.</p>
<p>Use all medications as directed. This medicine can affect the results of certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Prilosec.</p>
<p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Most patients heal within 4 to 8 weeks. Usual Adult Dose for Helicobacter pylori Infection: Beginning on day 15, omeprazole 20 mg orally once a day in the morning on days 15 to  If you are a frequent heartburn sufferer, you don't have to wait until you have heartburn symptoms to take Prilosec OTC.</p>
<p>It begins working on the very first day of treatment, and with one pill each morning for 14 days you can get zero heartburn. As with any OTC drug, it is important to read and follow all label directions. If you have questions regarding the label or use of Prilosec OTC, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. As part of a course of therapy, take only one pill a day to treat frequent heartburn for 24 hours. You may repeat this day treatment every four months, or as directed by your doctor.</p></p>
