		<p><p>For patients with end-stage renal failure, initial doses of lamotrigine should be based on patients' concomitant medicinal products; reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal functional impairment see sections 4.</p>
<p>Escalation and maintenance doses should be adjusted according to clinical response see section 5. The majority of rashes are mild and self-limiting, however serious rashes requiring hospitalisation and discontinuation of lamotrigine have also been reported. Life-threatening cutaneous reactions Stevens—Johnson syndrome SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis TEN have been reported with the use of lamotrigine see section 4.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions. Early withdrawal is associated with a better prognosis. If the patient has developed SJS or TEN with the use of lamotrigine, lamotrigine must not be re-started in this patient at any time. In adults enrolled in studies utilizing the current lamotrigine dosing recommendations the incidence of serious skin rashes is approximately 1 in in epilepsy patients.</p>
<p>Approximately half of these cases have been reported as Stevens—Johnson syndrome 1 in  In clinical trials in patients with bipolar disorder, the incidence of serious rash is approximately 1 in  The risk of serious skin rashes in children is higher than in adults. Available data from a number of studies suggest the incidence of rashes associated with hospitalisation in epileptic children is from 1 in to 1 in  In children, the initial presentation of a rash can be mistaken for an infection, physicians should consider the possibility of a reaction to lamotrigine treatment in children that develop symptoms of rash and fever during the first eight weeks of therapy.</p>
<p>Additionally the overall risk of rash appears to be strongly associated with: Caution is also required when treating patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs as the frequency of non-serious rash after treatment with lamotrigine was approximately three times higher in these patients than in those without such history.</p>
<p>All patients adults and children who develop a rash should be promptly evaluated and lamotrigine withdrawn immediately unless the rash is clearly not related to lamotrigine treatment. It is recommended that lamotrigine not be restarted in patients who have discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk.</p>
<p>Rash has also been reported as part of a hypersensitivity syndrome associated with a variable pattern of systemic symptoms including fever, lymphadenopathy, facial oedema and abnormalities of the blood and liver see section 4.</p>
<p>The syndrome shows a wide spectrum of clinical severity and may, rarely, lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity for example fever, lymphadenopathy may be present even though rash is not evident. Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Do not start or stop taking seizure medication during pregnancy without your doctor's advice.</p>
<p>Having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both mother and baby. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant. If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry. This is to track the outcome of the pregnancy and to evaluate any effects of lamotrigine on the baby. Birth control pills can make lamotrigine less effective, resulting in increased seizures.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you start or stop using birth control pills while you are taking lamotrigine. Your lamotrigine dose may need to be changed. It may not be safe to breast-feed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk. How should I take lamotrigine? Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.</p>
<p>Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Taking too much lamotrigine at the start of treatment may increase your risk of a severe life-threatening skin rash.</p>
<p>You can take it with or without food. Your doctor may also advise you to start or stop taking other medicines, depending on what condition you're being treated for and the way you respond to treatment.</p>
<p>Don't break, chew or crush them. Never take only part of a tablet. If you take more Lamotrigine tablets than you should If anyone takes too many Lamotrigine tablets, contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately. If possible, show them the Lamotrigine tablets packet. Someone who has taken too many Lamotrigine tablets may have any of these symptoms: If you forget to take Lamotrigine tablets Don't take extra tablets or a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p>
<p>If you have missed taking a dose of Lamotrigine tablets ask your doctor for advice on how to start taking it again. It's important that you do this. Don't stop taking Lamotrigine tablets without advice Take Lamotrigine tablets for as long as your doctor recommends.</p>
<p>Don't stop unless your doctor advises you to. If you are taking Lamotrigine tablets for epilepsy, to stop taking Lamotrigine tablets, it is important that your dose is reduced gradually, over about 2 weeks. If you suddenly stop taking Lamotrigine tablets your epilepsy may come back or get worse. If you are taking Lamotrigine tablets for bipolar disorder, Lamotrigine tablets may take some time to work, so you are unlikely to feel better straight away.</p>
<p>If you stop taking Lamotrigine tablets your dose will not need to be reduced gradually. However you should still talk to your doctor first if you want to stop taking Lamotrigine tablets. Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. Allergic reaction or potentially serious skin reaction, get a doctor's help straight away A small number of people taking Lamotrigine tablets have an allergic reaction or potentially serious skin reaction, which may develop into more serious, and even life-threatening, problems if they are not treated.</p>
<p>However, there is an increased risk of birth defects in babies whose mothers took lamotrigine during pregnancy. These defects include cleft lip or cleft palate. Pregnancy may also alter the effectiveness of Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets, so your doctor may take samples of your blood to check the level of lamotrigine, and may adjust your dose. The active ingredient of Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets passes into breast milk and may affect your baby.</p>
<p>Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of breast feeding while you are taking Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets, and will check your baby from time to time if you decide to breast feed.</p>
<p>Driving and using machines Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets can cause dizziness and double vision. If you have epilepsy, talk to your doctor about driving and using machines. The dose you take will depend on: Your doctor will start you on a low dose, and gradually increase the dose over a few weeks until you reach a dose that works for you called the effective dose. Never take more Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets than your doctor tells you to.</p>
<p>The usual effective dose of Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets for adults and children aged over 12 years is between mg and mg each day. How to take your dose of Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets Take your dose of Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets once or twice a day, as your doctor advises. You can take it with or without food. Always take the full dose that your doctor has prescribed. Never take only part of a tablet. You can take Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets by swallowing them whole with a little water, by chewing them, or by dissolving them in water: If you chew the tablet: You may need to drink a little water at the same time to help the tablet dissolve in your mouth.</p>
<p>Then drink some more water to make sure you have swallowed all the medicine. To make a liquid medicine: Put the tablet in a glass with at least enough water to cover the whole tablet. Either stir to dissolve, or wait for about a minute, until the tablet is fully dissolved. Drink all the liquid. If you take more Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets than you should If anyone takes too much Lamotrigine Dispersible Tablets Contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately.</p></p>
