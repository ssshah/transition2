        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Amoxicillin is used to treat many types of infections caused by bacteria, such as ear infections, bladder infections, pneumonia, gonorrhea, and E. Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman. When your doctor prescribes a new medication, be sure to discuss all your prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including dietary supplements, vitamins, botanicals, minerals, and herbals, as well as the foods you eat.</p>
<p>Always keep a current list of the drugs and supplements you take and review it with your health care providers and your pharmacist. If possible, use one pharmacy for all your prescription medications and over-the-counter products. This allows your pharmacist to keep a complete record of all your prescription drugs and to advise you about drug interactions and side effects.</p>
<p>For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. I got hives from taking amoxicillin. I still have them three weeks later, after I am off the medication.</p>
<p>Amoxil amoxicillin is an antibiotic used to stop bacterial infections, and side effects do not include hives. You may be having an allergic reaction and should contact your doctor. Many people are allergic to the medication, and if your doctor confirms an allergy, you should also let your pharmacy know, so they can put the information in their computers. That way, if any doctor prescribed a type of penicillin, the pharmacy will be alerted to the allergy. Common side effects from Amoxil amoxicillin may include upset stomach, diarrhea, and vomiting.</p>
<p>This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with Amoxil amoxicillin. Patti Brown, PharmD Q: Celestamine, Piriton, Amoxil, and Flugone are the drugs that I occasionally take. What are the side effects? Amoxil amoxicillin is an antibiotic that is used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. The most common side effects of amoxicillin are diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.</p>
<p>Rarely, severe side effects can occur when taking amoxicillin such as severe allergic reactions rash, hives, itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue ; bloody stools; confusion; dark urine; fever, chills, or persistent sore throat; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin; seizures; severe diarrhea; stomach pain or cramps; and unusual bruising or bleeding.</p>
<p>Stop taking amoxicillin immediately, and consult your physician immediately if any of these severe effects occur. Celestamine, Piriton, and Flugone are not approved for use in the United States; therefore, I cannot provide any information about these medications. Burton Dunaway, PharmD Q: When taking amoxicillin, do I need to wait 4 hours before eating yogurt? No, you do not have to wait 4 hours after taking your amoxicillin before eating yogurt.</p>
<p>Amoxicillin does not interact with dairy products like some of the other antibiotics. Megan Uehara, PharmD Q: Is it safe for me to take amoxicillin? Amoxicillin is a prescription antibiotic and is usually considered to be safe for use during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The FDA uses a pregnancy category system to classify the possible risks to a fetus when a specific medicine is taken during pregnancy. Pregnancy category B is given to medicines that have not been adequately studied in pregnant humans but do not appear to cause harm to the fetus in animal studies.</p>
<p>Amoxicillin is classified as a category B medication. A pregnancy category B medicine is given to a pregnant woman only if a health care provider believes that the benefits to the pregnant woman outweigh any possible risks to the unborn child. For instance, if the infection, left untreated, will do more harm than good for both you and the baby, this is the safest antibiotic to choose. Lori Poulin, PharmD Q: I've been trying to get pregnant.</p>
<p>I just got off the shot and am taking amoxicillin for my toothache. Does it increase my chance of getting pregnant? There exists no clinical data or evidence that amoxicillin can increase the chance of pregnancy. Lori Mendoza, PharmD Q: Is it okay to mix amoxicillin with formula so my baby drinks it all?</p>
<p>He is 2 months old. Yes, it is fine to mix amoxicillin with baby formula. It is important to give the dose immediately after mixing and to be sure the whole amount is taken to be sure the correct dose was given. Please see the following Everyday Health link for more information on children's health.</p>
<p>Laura Cable, PharmD Q: Is amoxicillin really safe to take while pregnant? Amoxicillin is a prescription antibiotic. It is usually considered to be safe for use during pregnancy. Pregnancy Category B is given to medicines that have not been adequately studied in pregnant humans but do not appear to cause harm to the fetus in animal studies. Amoxicillin is classified as a Category B medication. A pregnancy Category B medicine is given to a pregnant woman only if a health care provider believes that the benefits to the pregnant woman outweigh any possible risks to the unborn child.</p>
<p>Can amoxicillin treat bronchitis? Bronchitis is an inflammation of the air passages trachea; bronchi; bronchioles of the lungs.</p>
<p>The airways narrow, the air flow is reduced, and heavy mucus or phlegm is produced. This infection may be caused by a virus or bacterium. There are two types of bronchitis: The condition often clears up in two weeks or less. Chronic bronchitis is commonly associated with cigarette smoking. Repeated bouts of acute bronchitis can also lead to development of chronic bronchitis. If left untreated, serious respiratory problems, lung damage or heart failure may develop.</p>
<p>Acute viral bronchitis usually goes away on its own after a week. Antibiotics will not help because these medicines only kill bacteria. Bacterial bronchitis may require antibiotic treatment. It is important to get plenty of rest, to drink lots of fluid unless fluid restricted , and to treat the symptoms such as fever and headache with Tylenol as recommended by your doctor. You should also refrain from smoking.</p>
<p>Amoxil amoxicillin is a semi-synthetic antibiotic in the penicillin group of drugs. Amoxil acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Amoxil is used to treat many different types of infections caused by bacteria, such as ear infections, bladder infections, pneumonia, gonorrhea, and E. The most common side effects reported with Amoxil use include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis. Amoxil should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p>
<p>Prescribing Amoxil in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>Amoxicillin is used to treat many different types of infections caused by bacteria, such as ear infections, bladder infections, pneumonia, gonorrhea, and E. Amoxil may be taken without regard to meals every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength of the product prescribed.</p>
<p>Serious, and occasionally fatal, hypersensitivity reactions anaphylaxis have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibiotics. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral therapy. If an allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be instituted and Amoxil therapy discontinued. How do you take amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate? Augmentin is an oral antibacterial combination consisting of the semisynthetic antibiotic amoxicillin and the?</p>
<p>Amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin. The choice of antibiotic depends on the bacteria that are causing the infection, the severity of symptoms, the possibility of complications and the ability of the patient to take medicine by mouth. There are several types of antibiotics to treat a UTI. Video of the Day Penicillin The penicillin antibiotics include ampicillin, amoxicillin and Augmentin.</p>
<p>Penicillin antibiotics work by disrupting the process used by bacteria to create their cell walls. Some UTI bacteria have become resistant to the effects of penicillin antibiotics. Augmentin is a penicillin antibiotic that tries to circumvent the resistance of these bacteria. It has an added component, called clavulanic acid, which binds and inhibits the proteins used by these bacteria to become resistant to penicillin.</p>
<p>If superinfections occur, Amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematous skin rash.</p>
<p>Thus, ampicillin-class antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. Prescribing Amoxicillin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Laboratory Tests As with any potent drug, periodic assessment of renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic function should be made during prolonged therapy.</p>
<p>All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with Amoxicillin should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months. Drug Interactions Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of Amoxicillin. Concurrent use of Amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of Amoxicillin.</p>
<p>Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.</p>
<p>This effect may also occur with Amoxicillin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Studies to detect mutagenic potential of Amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4: Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay.</p>
<p>Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was negative in the mouse micronucleus test, and in the dominant lethal assay in mice.</p>
<p>Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 10 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Amoxicillin.</p></p>
