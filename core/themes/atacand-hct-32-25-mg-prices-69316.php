		<p><p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue Atacand HCT, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when pregnant mice, rats or rabbits were treated orally with candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. Doses compared on the basis of body surface area. MRHD considered to be 32 mg for candesartan cilexetil and  Hypotension Atacand HCT can cause symptomatic hypotension. Patients with symptomatic hypotension may require temporarily reducing the dose of Atacand HCT or volume repletion.</p>
<p>In such patients, Atacand HCT therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of candesartan or diuretic is increased. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system e.</p>
<p>Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Atacand HCT. Potassium Abnormalities Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia, which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma.</p>
<p>Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled.</p>
<p>Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. Hypersensitivity Reaction Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. Precautions Metabolic Disturbances Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Thiazides decrease urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevation of serum calcium.</p>
<p>Avoid using Atacand HCT in patients with hypercalcemia. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Information for Patients Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to Atacand HCT during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Symptomatic Hypotension Tell patients receiving Atacand HCT that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. Tell patients that if syncope occurs, discontinue Atacand HCT until the physician has been consulted. Tell all patients that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope.</p>
<p>Hyperkalemia Tell patients receiving Atacand HCT not to use potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels without consulting the prescribing physician. Drug Interactions Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected.</p>
<p>Interactions common to both Candesartan Cilexetil and Hydrochlorothiazide Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors COX-2 Inhibitors In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted including those on diuretic therapy , or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.</p>
<p>These effects are usually reversible. Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use. Interactions with Candesartan Cilexetil Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System RAS Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function including acute renal failure compared to monotherapy. Co-administration of Atacand HCT with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia.</p>
<p>Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Do not co-administer aliskiren with Atacand HCT in patients with diabetes. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or hours after the administration of resins.</p>
<p>Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing e. Noradrenaline — Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone — Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH. Cytotoxic products — Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products e. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Rats received the drug by gavage whereas mice received the drug by dietary administration. These maximally-tolerated doses of candesartan cilexetil provided systemic exposures to candesartan AUCs that were, in mice, approximately 7 times and, in rats, more than 70 times the exposure in man at the maximum recommended daily human dose 32 mg. The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Candesartan cilexetil or candesartan the active metabolite , in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, tested positive in vitro in the Chinese hamster lung CHL chromosomal aberration assay and mouse lymphoma mutagenicity assay.</p>
<p>Both candesartan and its O-deethyl metabolite tested positive for genotoxicity in the in vitro CHL chromosomal aberration assay. Neither compound tested positive in the Ames microbial mutagenesis assay or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay. Candesartan but not its O-deethyl metabolite was also evaluated in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test and in vitro in the Chinese hamster ovary CHO gene mutation assay, in both cases with negative results.</p>
<p>Candesartan cilexetil was evaluated in the Ames test, the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay, the in vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, in each case with negative results. When hydrochlorothiazide was tested alone, positive results were obtained in vitro in the CHO sister chromatid exchange clastogenicity and mouse lymphoma cell mutagenicity assays and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test for point mutations and the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. No fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk.</p>
<p>Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Adverse Reactions Candesartan Cilexetil-Hydrochlorothiazide Atacand HCT has been evaluated for safety in more than patients treated for hypertension.</p>
<p>More than of these patients were studied for at least six months and more than patients were treated for at least one year. Adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with Atacand HCT was comparable to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse experiences was not related to dose, age, gender, or race.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled trials that included patients treated with various combinations of candesartan cilexetil doses of mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6. Post-Marketing Experience The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience with candesartan cilexetil: Abnormal hepatic function and hepatitis. Neutropenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Angioedema Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Cough Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, rash and urticaria.</p>
<p>Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse experiences that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Limited data are available in regard to overdosage with candesartan cilexetil in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic vagal stimulation.</p>
<p>If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. For hydrochlorothiazide, the most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis.</p>
<p>If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.</p>
<p>Treatment To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult your Regional Poison Control Center. In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and altered pharmacokinetics in your patient.</p>
<p>Atacand HCT Dosage and Administration The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg.</p>
<p>Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of  Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension , renal failure, and death. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents.</p>
<p>Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the reninangiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy.</p>

There was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when pregnant mice, rats or rabbits were treated orally with candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice , thrombocytopenia , and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. In such patients, ATACAND HCT therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of candesartan or diuretic is increased.</p>

<p>When hydrochlorothiazide was tested alone, positive results were obtained in vitro in the CHO sister chromatid exchange clastogenicity and mouse lymphoma cell mutagenicity assays and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunciton assay. Hydrochorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test for point mutations and the CHO test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes , Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene.</p>
<p>No fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p>If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Limited data are available in regard to overdosage with candesartan cilexetil in humans.</p>
<p>The most likely manifestations of overdosage with candesartan cilexetil would be hypotension , dizziness, and tachycardia ; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic vagal stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. For hydrochlorothiazide, the most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion hypokalemia , hypochloremia , hyponatremia and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Candesartan cannot be removed by hemodialysis. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established. Treatment To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult your Regional Poison Control Center. In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and altered pharmacokinetics in your patient. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction , stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone , cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium.</p>
<p>Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.</p>
<p>Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE kininase II , it does not affect the response to bradykinin.</p>
<p>Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.</p></p>

In spite of the effect of candesartan cilexetil on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Most of the antihypertensive effect of the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide was seen in 1 to 2 weeks with the full effect observed within 4 weeks. Post-Marketing Experience The following have been very rarely reported in post-marketing experience with candesartan cilexetil: A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from Atacand HCT </p><br clear="left" />
