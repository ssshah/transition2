		<p><p>No studies regarding mutagenesis have been performed. Pregnancy Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits.</p>
<p>Occasional anomalies reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage.</p>
<p>Although all of these anomalies were not present in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. The clinical significance of the above findings is not known.</p>
<p>However, an increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and meprobamate during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because the use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, the use of Lorazepam during this period should be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant, they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug. In humans, blood levels obtained from umbilical cord blood indicate placental transfer of Lorazepam and Lorazepam glucuronide. Infants of mothers who ingested benzodiazepines for several weeks or more preceding delivery have been reported to have withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period.</p>
<p>Symptoms such as hypoactivity, hypotonia, hypothermia, respiratory depression, apnea, feeding problems, and impaired metabolic response to cold stress have been reported in neonates born of mothers who have received benzodiazepines during the late phase of pregnancy or at delivery. Nursing Mothers Lorazepam has been detected in human breast milk; therefore, it should not be administered to breastfeeding women, unless the expected benefit to the woman outweighs the potential risk to the infant.</p>
<p>Sedation and inability to suckle have occurred in neonates of lactating mothers taking benzodiazepines. Infants of lactating mothers should be observed for pharmacological effects including sedation and irritability.</p>
<p>Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as hepatic or renal impairment, should be considered. Does Ativan lower blood pressure? Ativan itself can rarely lower blood pressure. However, it is known to potentiate the effect of medicines used to treat high blood pressure, and cause excessive lowering of blood pressure Q.</p>
<p>Does Ativan make you sleepy? Yes, excessive sleepiness and daytime drowsiness are few of the side-effects of Ativan Q. Lorazepam is not intended for the primary treatment of psychotic illness or depressive disorders, and should not be used alone to treat depressed patients.</p>
<p>The use of benzodiazepines may have a disinhibiting effect and may release suicidal tendencies in depressed patients. Therefore, large quantities of Lorazepam should not be prescribed to these patients. Pre-existing depression may emerge during benzodiazepine use. The use of benzodiazepines may lead to physical and psychological dependence.</p>
<p>The risk of dependence on Lorazepam is low when used at the recommended dose and duration, but increases with higher doses and longer-term use.</p>
<p>The risk of dependence is further increased in patients with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse, or in patients with significant personality disorders.</p>
<p>Therefore, use in individuals with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse should be avoided. Dependence may lead to withdrawal symptoms, especially if treatment is discontinued abruptly. Therefore, the drug should always be discontinued gradually. It may be useful to inform the patient that treatment will be of limited duration and that it will be discontinued gradually.</p>
<p>The patient should also be made aware of the possibility of "rebound" phenomena to minimise anxiety should they occur. Abuse of benzodiazepines has been reported. No studies regarding mutagenesis have been performed. Pregnancy Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage.</p>
<p>Although all of these anomalies were not present in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. The clinical significance of the above findings is not known. However, an increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and meprobamate during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies.</p>
<p>Because the use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, the use of lorazepam during this period should be avoided. Lorazepam can become addicting if used over a long period of time; however, it can be easily stopped by using the proper tapering dosages.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking this medication, or increase the dosage, without first talking with your health care provider. I have insomnia and the classic medications like AmbienCR tend to give me hangover effects. My doctor had me try Lorazepam, which actually works quite well. I am interested in potential long term negative effects. I am 56 and have had a sleep analysis -- no sleep apnea. Lorazepam used in small dosage are used to treat sleep disorders. This medication can become addicting is used over a long period of time but can be easily stopped by the proper tapering dose to eliminate any side effects from stopping this medication.</p>
<p>Do not just stop taking with out first talking with your Health Care Provider. Used in small dosages, Lorazepam works quite well in treating sleep disorders, such as insomnia. Lorazepam can become addicting over a long period of time; however, it can easily be stopped by properly tapering down the dosage without any serious side effects.</p>
<p>Do not abruptly stop the taking Lorazepam. Only use this medications they way you have been instructed by your health care provider. Do not increase dosage without talking to your health care provider first, if you feel you are not getting the same results after using this medication for a period of time. To facilitate this, 0. For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime.</p>
<p>The dosage of Ativan lorazepam should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses.</p>
<p>Dispense in a tight container. In a sample of about patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to Ativan lorazepam was sedation  The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by Ativan lorazepam.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium , and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam.</p>
<p>Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance.</p>
<p>The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam.</p>
<p>Ativan lorazepam is not recommended for use in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis.</p></p>

For Intermezzo brand of sublingual zolpidem tablets, reduce the dose to 1. The effects of probenecid and valproate on Lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. As with all patients on CNS-depressant drugs, patients receiving Lorazepam should be warned not to Operate dangerous machinery or tablet vehicles and that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants will be diminished. As with other benzodiazepines, periodic blood counts <i>lorazepam</i> liver-function tests are recommended for patients on long-term therapy.
