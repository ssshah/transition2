		<p><p>Unless given IV, a drug must cross several semipermeable cell membranes before it reaches the systemic circulation. Cell membranes are biologic barriers that selectively inhibit passage of drug molecules. The membranes are composed primarily of a bimolecular lipid matrix, which determines membrane permeability characteristics. Drugs may cross cell membranes by Passive diffusion Active transport Pinocytosis Sometimes various globular proteins embedded in the matrix function as receptors and help transport molecules across the membrane.</p>
<p>Drugs diffuse across a cell membrane from a region of high concentration eg, GI fluids to one of low concentration eg, blood. Because the cell membrane is lipoid, lipid-soluble drugs diffuse most rapidly. Small molecules tend to penetrate membranes more rapidly than larger ones. Most drugs are weak organic acids or bases, existing in un-ionized and ionized forms in an aqueous environment. The un-ionized form is usually lipid soluble lipophilic and diffuses readily across cell membranes.</p>
<p>The ionized form has low lipid solubility but high water solubility—ie, hydrophilic and high electrical resistance and thus cannot penetrate cell membranes easily. The pKa is the pH at which concentrations of ionized and un-ionized forms are equal. When the pH is lower than the pKa, the un-ionized form of a weak acid predominates, but the ionized form of a weak base predominates.</p>
<p>Thus, in plasma pH 7. Therefore, when a weak acid is given orally, most of the drug in the stomach is un-ionized, favoring diffusion through the gastric mucosa. For a weak base with a pKa of 4. Theoretically, weakly acidic drugs eg, aspirin are more readily absorbed from an acid medium stomach than are weakly basic drugs eg, quinidine.</p>
<p>Nursing Mothers Erythromycin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman. Erythromycin Tablets mg contain  The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading.</p>
<p>This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure. Adverse Reactions The most frequent side effects of oral erythromycin preparations are gastrointestinal and are dose-related. They include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and anorexia. Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis have occurred. Skin reactions ranging from mild eruptions to erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely.</p>
<p>There have been reports of interstitial nephritis coincident with erythromycin use. There have been rare reports of pancreatitis and convulsions. There have been isolated reports of reversible hearing loss occurring chiefly in patients with renal insufficiency and in patients receiving high doses of erythromycin. Overdosage In case of overdosage, erythromycin should be discontinued. Overdosage should be handled with the prompt elimination of unabsorbed drug and all other appropriate measures should be instituted.</p>
<p>Erythromycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Erythromycin Tablets Dosage and Administration In most patients, Erythromycin Tablets are well absorbed and may be dosed orally without regard to meals.</p>
<p>Adults The usual dosage of Erythromycin Tablets is one mg tablet four times daily in equally spaced doses or one mg tablet every 12 hours. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. However, twice-a-day dosing is not recommended when doses larger than 1 g daily are administered. Children Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. For more severe infections this dosage may be doubled but should not exceed 4 g per day.</p>
<p>In the treatment of streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract e. The American Heart Association suggests a dosage of mg of erythromycin orally, twice a day in long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections for the prevention of recurring attacks of rheumatic fever in patients allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides.</p>
<p>Urogenital Infections During Pregnancy Due to Chlamydia trachomatis Although the optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been established, the suggested treatment is mg of erythromycin by mouth four times a day on an empty stomach for at least 7 days.</p>
<p>For women who cannot tolerate this regimen, a decreased dose of one erythromycin mg tablet orally every 12 hours or mg by mouth four times a day should be used for at least 14 days. They are available as follows: Bottle of tablets: Prevention of Rheumatic Fever. Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis after pertussis prophylaxis with erythromycin: Primary Syphilis PO 30 to 40 g erythromycin ethylsuccinate 48 to 64 g in divided doses over a period of 10 to 15 days.</p>
<p>Prophylaxis of Neonatal Gonococcal or Chlamydia Conjunctivitis Newborns Ophthalmic 1-cm ribbon of ointment placed in each conjunctival sac at time of delivery. Skin Infections Topical Apply 1 to 4 times daily to affected area. Systemic Use Adults PO to mg every 6 h, mg every 12 h, or mg every 8 h. Uncomplicated Urethral, Endocervical, or Rectal Infections Adults PO mg 4 times daily or two mg tablets every 8 h for at least 7 days.</p>
<p>Upper Respiratory Tract Infections Adults PO mg every 6 h, mg every 8 h, or mg every 12 h for at least 10 days. Urethritis Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum mg every 8 h for 7 days.</p>
<p>Urogenital Infections During Pregnancy Adults PO mg 4 times daily or two mg tablets every 8 h for at least 7 days. For women who cannot tolerate this regimen, mg every 12 h, mg every 8 h, or mg 4 times daily for at least 14 days.</p>
<p>Not for intradermal, subcutaneous, IM, IV bolus, or intra-arterial administration. For intermittent infusion, infuse prescribed dose over a period of 20 to 60 min at intervals of 6 h or less. Inspect solution visually before administration. Do not administer if solution is cloudy or discolored, or contains particulate matter. Ophthalmic ointment For topical instillation in the eye only. Not for use in the ear or on the skin. Wash hands before and after instilling ointment. Legionnaires' disease Although optimal doses have not been established, doses utilized in reported clinical data were those recommended above 1 to 4 grams daily in divided doses.</p>
<p>Urogenital infections during pregnancy due to Chlamydia trachomatis Although the optimal dose and duration of therapy have not been established, the suggested treatment is erythromycin mg, by mouth , 4 times a day on an empty stomach for at least 7 days. For women who cannot tolerate this regimen , a decreased dose of mg, by mouth, 4 times a day should be used for at least 14 days. For adults with uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in whom tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated: Nongonococcal urethritis due to Ureaplasma urealyticum When tetracycline is contraindicated or not tolerated: Acute pelvic inflammatory disease due to N gonorrhoeae mg IV of erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP every 6 hours for 3 days followed by mg of erythromycin, orally every six hours for 7 days.</p>
<p>The pellets are colored white and orange. Capsules are supplied in bulk containers of 75, NDC  Prevention of Rheumatic Fever. They include nausea , vomiting, abdominal pain , diarrhea and anorexia.</p>
<p>Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis have occurred. Skin reactions ranging from mild eruptions to erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome , and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely.</p>
<p>There have been reports of interstitial nephritis coincident with erythromycin use. There have been reports of pancreatitis and convulsions. There have been isolated reports of reversible hearing loss occurring chiefly in patients with renal insufficiency and in patients receiving high doses of erythromycin.</p>
<p>There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a significant decrease in erythromycin serum concentrations of approximately 35 percent. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to coadministration of theophylline could result in subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin.</p>
<p>Hypotension , bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly.</p>
<p>Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with oral anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly. Co-administration of erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible.</p>
<p>The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: Triazolobenzodiazepines such as triazolam and alprazolam and related benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly.</p>
<p>Sildenafil Viagra Erythromycon has been reported to increase the systemic exposure AUC of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. See Viagra package insert. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin with carbamazepine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, bromocriptine, rifabutin, quinidine methylprednisolone, cilostazol, and vinblastine.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.</p></p>
