		<p><p>Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.</p>
<p>Assessing Cardiovascular Status In Patients Being Treated With Stimulant Medications Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease e.</p>
<p>Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope , or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation. Psychiatric Adverse Events Preexisting Psychosis Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder.</p>
<p>Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.</p>
<p>Aggression Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in patients with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility.</p>
<p>Seizures There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures.</p>
<p>In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal drug holidays or during discontinuation. Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation e. Long-Term Suppression Of Growth Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or nonmedication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and nonmedicationtreated children over 36 months to the ages of 10 to 13 years , suggests that consistently medicated children i.</p>
<p>Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause similar suppression of growth; however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. Visual Disturbance Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment.</p>
<p>There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations. Dosage Concerta is only available as an extended-release tablet. Adderall is available as an immediate-release and extended-release drug.</p>
<p>In the immediate-release form, the tablet releases the drug into your system right away. In the extended-release form, the capsule slowly releases small amounts of medication into your body throughout the day.</p>
<p>If your doctor prescribes Adderall, they may start you on the immediate-release form at first. Eventually, they may change you to the extended-release form. If you take an extended-release drug, you may only need one dose per day to manage your symptoms. The standard dosage of each drug starts at 10—20 mg per day. However, your dosage depends on certain factors. This includes your age, other health issues you have, and how you respond to the drug.</p>
<p>Stimulants like Concerta and Ritalin may help reduce symptoms such as fidgeting, hyperactivity, short attention span, and more. Despite the name of this class of drugs, stimulants actually have calming effects on the brain. They work by increasing levels of the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine. These chemicals play a role in ADHD.</p>
<p>Concerta is a long-acting drug: It increases dopamine steadily. This means that you only need to take it once per day for all-day symptom relief. According to the Cleveland Clinic, Concerta works for 10 to 12 hours. The effects may wear off by the end of the day. On the other hand, Ritalin is a short-acting, immediate-release stimulant. This means that it works quickly in your body.</p></p>
