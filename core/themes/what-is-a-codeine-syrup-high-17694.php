		<p><p>A spokesman for the coroner's office said that the combination of sleep apnea and cough medication probably suppressed Pimp C's breathing long enough to bring on his death. According to TMZ, he had been suffering from liver and kidney problems, which were believed to be the result of his lean addiction. Kiel was charged with two felony counts of transporting a controlled substance and three counts of possession for sale of a controlled substance.</p>
<p>The officers found a Dr Pepper bottle in a holder next to two Styrofoam cups containing soda and ice. The officers said the cups and the bottle all emitted "strong odors of codeine.</p>
<p>Jolly faced a possible maximum sentence of up to 20 years in jail, but as a first time offender he would be eligible for probation.</p>
<p>He was arrested as part of an undercover narcotics investigation. Russell was booked into city jail and released soon afterwards after making his bail. Several legal commercial products loosely based on the concept of "purple drank" are marketed in the United States. The commercial product contains no codeine or promethazine, but claims to "Slow Your Roll" with a combination of herbal ingredients such as valerian root and rose hips as well as the hormone melatonin.</p>
<p>Evidence supporting the hypothesis that ultrarapid metabolizers may get greater analgesia from codeine due to increased morphine formation is limited to case reports. Guidelines released by the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium CPIC advise against administering codeine to ultrarapid metabolizers, where this genetic information is available. The CPIC also suggests that codeine use be avoided in poor metabolizers, due to its lack of efficacy in this group.</p>
<p>Codeine and its metabolites are excreted almost entirely by the kidney, mainly as conjugates with glucuronic acid. Chemistry[ edit ] Relation to other opioids[ edit ] Codeine has been used in the past as the starting material and prototype of a large class of mainly mild to moderately strong opioids; such as hydrocodone in Germany , oxycodone in Germany , dihydrocodeine in Germany , and its derivatives such as nicocodeine in Austria.</p>
<p>In general, the various classes of morphine derivatives such as ketones, semisynthetics like dihydromorphine , halogeno-morphides, esters, ethers, and others have codeine, dihydrocodeine, and isocodeine analogues. As an analgesic, codeine compares weakly to other opiates. Related to codeine in other ways are codoxime , thebacon , codeine-N-oxide genocodeine , related to the nitrogen morphine derivatives as is codeine methobromide, and heterocodeine , which is a drug six times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than codeine due to a small re-arrangement of the molecule, viz.</p>
<p>Drugs bearing resemblance to codeine in effects due to close structural relationship are variations on the methyl groups at the 3 position including ethylmorphine a. While having no narcotic effects of its own, the important opioid precursor thebaine differs from codeine only slightly in structure. Pseudocodeine and some other similar alkaloids not currently used in medicine are found in trace amounts in opium as well.</p>
<p>History[ edit ] Codeine, or 3-methylmorphine, is an alkaloid found in the opium poppy , Papaver somniferum var.</p>
<p>Opium poppy has been cultivated and utilized throughout human history for a variety of medicinal analgesic, anti-tussive and anti-diarrheal and hypnotic properties linked to the diversity of its active components, which include morphine, codeine and papaverine. Until the beginning of the 19th century, raw opium was used in diverse preparations known as laudanum see Thomas de Quincey 's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater , and paregoric elixirs , a number of which were popular in England since the beginning of the 18th century; the original preparation seems to have been elaborated in Leiden , the Netherlands around by a chemist named Lemort; in the London Pharmacopoeia mentions an Elixir Asthmaticum, replaced by the term Elixir Paregoricum "pain soother" in  The progressive isolation of opium's several active components opened the path to improved selectivity and safety of the opiates-based pharmacopeia.</p>
<p>Codeine is the most widely used opiate in the world, [43] [44] and is one of the most commonly used drugs overall according to numerous reports by organizations including the World Health Organization and its League of Nations predecessor agency. It is one of the most effective orally administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin. While codeine can be directly extracted from opium, its original source, most codeine is synthesized from the much more abundant morphine through the process of O- methylation , [44] [45] through a process first completed in the late 20th century by Robert C.</p>
<p>Corcoran and Junning Ma. They quickly succeeded using petroleum or coal tar and a process developed at the United States' National Institutes of Health. Numerous codeine salts have been prepared since the drug was discovered. The most commonly used are the hydrochloride freebase conversion ratio 0. Uses Uses This combination product is used to treat symptoms caused by the common cold , flu , allergies , hay fever , or other breathing illnesses e.</p>
<p>Decongestants help relieve stuffy nose symptoms. This product also contains an opioid cough suppressant antitussive that affects a certain part of the brain , reducing the urge to cough. Do not use this product in children younger than 18 years.</p>
<p>There is a risk of serious rarely fatal side effects, such as breathing problems. Cough -and-cold products do not cure colds. Cough due to a common cold often does not need to be treated with medicine.</p>
<p>How to use Codeine Antitussive Cough Syrup Read the Medication Guide if available from your pharmacist before you start taking this product and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you are taking the over-the-counter product to self-treat, read all directions on the product package before taking this medication.
