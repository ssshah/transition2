<p>Okieshellie3 New Member 4 years on site 3 posts So am I the only person on here that has had a bad experience with Omeprazole? I am depressed, my hair is breaking off, my skin dry, no energy, just have turned into a hermit. This being said I felt better before I started taking it. I tried to explain this to my doctor and he told me he had not heard those reactions from anyone.</p>
<p>I read on another site to take extra B12, B1, Biotin, Magnesium and cinnamon to help with energy and bloating that I get. All helped with bloating but not mood or energy. High dose PPIs for a long period can cause deficiencies in essential minerals and vitamins resulting in lethargy.</p>
<p>You may need supplements.</p></p>
