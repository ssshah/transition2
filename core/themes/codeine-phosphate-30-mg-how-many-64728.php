		<p><p>Codeine hydrochloride is more common worldwide and the citrate, hydroiodide, hydrobromide, tartrate, and other salts are also seen. Brand named as Phenergan with Codeine or in generic form as promethazine with codeine.</p>
<p>In the s it started to be used as a recreational drug and was called 'syrup', 'lean', or ' purple drank '. Drug abuse screening programs generally test urine , hair , sweat or saliva. Many commercial opiate screening tests directed at morphine cross-react appreciably with codeine and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish codeine from other opiates and opioids.</p>
<p>It is important to note that codeine usage results in significant amounts of morphine as an excretion product. Furthermore, heroin contains codeine or acetyl codeine as an impurity and its use will result in excretion of small amounts of codeine. Poppy seed foods represent yet another source of low levels of codeine in one's biofluids. Australia[ edit ] In Australia, Since February 1, , preparations containing codeine are not available without a prescription.</p>
<p>Schedule 8 preparations are subject to the strictest regulation of all medications available to consumers. A similar tablet called "A. Both tablets are kept behind the counter and must be dispensed by a pharmacist who may limit quantities. Names of many codeine and dihydrocodeine products in Canada tend to follow the narcotic content number system Tylenol With Codeine No.</p>
<p>Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Vomiting should be induced mechanically, or with syrup of ipecac , if the patient is alert adequate pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes.</p>
<p>The first dose should be accompanied by an appropriate cathartic. If repeated doses are used, the cathartic might be included with alternate doses as required. Hypotension is usually hypovolemic and should respond to fluids. Vasopressors and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. A cuffed endo-tracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the unconscious patient and, when necessary, to provide assisted respiration.</p>
<p>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation. In severe cases of intoxication, peritoneal dialysis , or preferably hemodialysis , may be considered. If hypoprothrombinemia occurs due to acetaminophen overdose, vitamin K should be administered intravenously.</p>
<p>Naloxone , a narcotic antagonist , can reverse respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose. Since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration.</p>
<p>A narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression.</p>
<p>Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained, since levels four or more hours following ingestion help predict acetaminophen toxicity. Do not await acetaminophen assay results before initiating treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be obtained initially, and repeated at hour intervals.</p>
<p>Toxic Doses for adults Acetaminophen: Pharmacokinetics The behavior of the individual components is described below. Codeine Codeine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Do not take more than mg in 24 hours. To prevent coughing or to treat chronic diarrhoea Not suitable for children. Codeine Phosphate Tablets should not be taken by children below the age of 12 years, due to the risk of severe breathing problems. This medicine should not be taken for more than 3 days.</p>
<p>If the pain does not improve after 3 days, talk to your doctor for advice. Do not stop taking your medicines suddenly. Ask your doctor how to reduce the dose gradually. If you take more tablets than you should If you accidentally take too much of your medicine, tell your doctor at once or contact your nearest hospital casualty department. Hypotension and tachycardia are possible but unlikely. Management This should include general symptomatic and supportive measures including a clear airway and monitoring of vital signs until stable.</p>
<p>Give naloxone if coma or respiratory depression is present. Naloxone is a competitive antagonist and has a short half-life so large and repeated doses may be required in a seriously poisoned patient.</p>
<p>Observe for at least four hours after ingestion, or eight hours if a sustained release preparation has been taken. Codeine is an analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine but it is much less potent as an analgesic and has only mild sedative effects. It is also used in the treatment of cough and diarrhoea. The usual dose is: For the relief of mild to moderate pain: For the relief and prevention of coughing: For the treatment of prolonged diarrhoea: Codeine phosphate tablets are not recommended for children.</p></p>

Related to codeine in other ways are codoximethebaconcodeine-N-oxide genocodeinerelated to the nitrogen morphine derivatives as is codeine methobromide, and heterocodeinewhich is a drug six times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than codeine due to a small re-arrangement of the molecule, viz.

What Codeine Phosphate Tablets look like and the contents of the pack: Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism conjugation and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. For the relief of mild to moderate pain: The usual doses of Codeine Phosphate Tablets are as follows: At normal therapeutic doses codeine and its active metabolites may be present in breast milk at very low doses and is unlikely to adversely affect the breast fed infant. Opioid toxicity If symptoms of opioid toxicity develop in either the mother or the infant, then all codeine containing medicines should be stopped and alternative non-opioid analgesics prescribed.</p><br clear="left" />

Section 3, how a India[ edit ] Codeine preparations require a <b>codeine</b> in India. At therapeutic doses, the analgesic effect reaches a peak within 2 <b>phosphates</b> and persists between 4 and 6 hours. Tell your doctor if you are having any blood tests done whilst you are taking codeine phosphate. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in non-ambulatory patients, and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down. The progressive isolation of opium's several active components opened the path to improved selectivity and safety of the opiates-based pharmacopeia. Since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the naloxone, the <i>codeine</i> should be kept under continuous surveillance how repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration.
