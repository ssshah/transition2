Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Dosage Information in more detail What happens if I miss a dose? Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.</p>
<p>Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. What happens if I overdose? Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at  What should I avoid while taking medroxyprogesterone? Avoid smoking while you are taking this medicine.

<p>Caregivers should wear rubber gloves while cleaning up a patient's body fluids, handling contaminated trash or laundry or changing diapers. Wash hands before and after removing gloves. Wash soiled clothing and linens separately from other laundry.</p>
<p>I had 7 cysts on my ovaries and after 3 months they had reduced drastically and after 6 months no more cysts! Maybe you could talk to your doctor about it? I did get pregnant off the first clomid cycle but unfortunately had a miscarriage.</p>
<p>It will happen for you just as am sure it will happen for all of us. God has a plan for all of us. We may not always understand why done women have it so easy and others like us don't, but I am confident that everything will happen in God's time. He knows how much we all want a little one and I know he will make it happen for us. Please don't get discourage, keep your head and hopes up because at least we have doctors that are willing to work with you and give you medication to bring you closer to your dream.</p>
<p>For that we should all be thankful B BabyHopes You ladies are all so so so great! I look forward to coming home and getting on here to read all the posts and get all the great feed back! But on the 24th I will be on pill number 5 of provera and everday 2 pills of provera at mg a pill mg a day I am hoping that this cycle will be our lucky cycle and we wont even have to worry about the next cycle but if we do end up not succeeding this cycle, I think next cycle I will request a higher dosage of metformin and more clomid.</p>
<p>Depending if my blood test on cycle day 29 comes back saying I did or didnt ovulate correctly. Ugh, I just feel like ive been going in circles: Thanks again so much for everything ladies!</p>
<p>All of the success stories and women who are on the same page as me really help me feel better: I am so excited for the wedding! Only 2 weeks to go now! And im sure we will have a blast in the bahamas and I wont try to think so much on TTC while on vacation but who knows! Could be just the perfect baby making formula! Found out I wasn't o'ing on my own, which is why I wasn't getting AF. Oh, and I'm also on Metformin mg daily, which is supposed to help regulate AF as well so either we'll see about that or hopefully I will just get my BFP.</p>
<p>I will be testing on the anniversary of our 2nd year trying. I'm happy to say that I've been taking it for 3 weeks now and have only had 1 gross day, and even that only lasted in the morning before I left for work. Remember, you're body may react well with the meds, they are not side effects for everyone B BabyHopes ksheds For sure keep me posted on what happens!</p>
<p>Sounds like you are on the exact same meds as me and have the exact same thing going on! We have been trying since february of this year so only 8 months so far but still feels like forever! Made the appointment and she does an exam on me and refers me to a specialist to have a vaginal ultrasound.</p>
<p>She puts me on: Medroxypergesterone 10mg And since I'm on anti - depressants it limits the birth control options for me. Ortho Progesterone 28's I started the Medroxyprogesterone and by the 8th out of 10 days, I finally stopped my period. I was happy and had energy. Read More Reiss gives women big-time credit for kind of self-adjusting their hormones based on how they feel and respond. Or, I am wondering if you are at a point where you might call Dr.</p>
<p>She has been doing this for about years. Let me know how things are going. Read More down there all the time - same with armpits. I never before had any foul body odor - now, no matter how much I bathe the smell won't go away.</p></p>
