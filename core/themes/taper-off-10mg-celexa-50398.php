		<p><p>The problem was, I got down to 2. Read More 37PM on my third day of recovery and first day of my tapering schedule. So far it's going pretty well. I'm getting really hopeful because the last day of my schedule is my 20th birthday, February 3rd. I'm going to celebrate by taking that last half of a pill and flushing the rest of them down the toilet.</p>
<p>It keeps me motivated. Read More I have been experiencing Nausea on and off for weeks since my Dr. I have since been tapering off back down to 20mg, and have been on 20mg for 2 weeks now. The nausea however persists, can this be a side affect of celexa.</p>
<p>Also, when the Dr. They were so bad that I went to the ER twice. I was and am feeling better. The biggest concern for me was medication interactions. I hated not being able to take an antibiotic or Tylenol without worrying about the possible side-effects. So, while on vacation a few weeks back, I decided to taper off. I took one every other day for a week.</p>
<p>Then one every 3 days, then stopped. Sex drive is back, no severe side-effects, though I am currently experiencing some tummy troubles and sleep issues â€” all related to withdrawal. Overall, I am completely happy with my decision and I feel like a brand new me. Best of luck to everyone undertaking the process to come off. Just make sure you have some tools and resources in your pocket to help cope with withdrawal symptoms; as well as possible recurrence of original symptoms.</p>
<p>Reply Link Ashley July 13, , 1: I am currently getting off as well. My last pill 5mg was last Sunday. It has been an up and down week emotionally and lots of brain fogs.</p>
<p>Thanks for the encouragement! Reply Link Chrissy July 10, , 1: About 2 weeks ago I forgot to take it was feeling good and have stopped. Was feeling the same symptomsâ€¦ fatigue, dizziness, headache, irritability, bathroom issues, night sweats and my joints hurt.</p>
<p>I also realized it looks like I am going through my change. So I was curious if how I am feeling was withdraw from the medicine, change or both.</p>
<p>However, I do take a small dose of a sleeping pill. Reply Link Allison July 9, , 5: It took 9 months of slowly weaning, but I was successful with no withdrawal symptoms. Reply Link Gail July 9, , 6: I will look into the liquid form for tapering off, as well. Gail Reply Link Allison July 9, , 8: I was on celexa for 12 years at 20mg. I dropped down 1 mg every weeks. It took almost 9 months. Reply Link Gail July 9, ,  Would you please update your status after being off for a full month?</p>
<p>Going much slower and in 1 mg increments will probably be the key! Did you take any other supplements to assist in this process? Gail Reply Link Allison July 10, , 8: Link Tiffany July 8, , 4: By the time I got home I was already a week off, and I been wanting to stop them, so I just went with it. I have now been off of them for about 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The first few days I was fine. Except in traffic on the way back home, or going over bridges. I have also noticed I am so emotional. I cried getting my car washed yesterday, at movie trailers, during conversations with people, etc. I have gained about 5lbs and I am on topamax already for migraines, but I have been getting some pretty gruesome headaches for which I am using 2 Aleve to take away. Now I am going on 2 weeks. I know it has to get better with each day that passes.</p>
<p>Reply Link Ellen July 6, , 9: I tried to come off once before but the irritability was awful and ruining my home life so I went back on 20mg. Brain for, tiredness, emotional wreck, nervous etc and an upset stomach. So many of us experiencing the same frustrations. I thought the hardest thing would be going on them.</p>
<p>I was very wrong. My sex drive whilst on them was minimal and the confusion and sweats unbearable. Reply Link Seana July 6, , 3: A little background story: I was taking it for a little over a year and recently decided to get off of it to try to have a baby in the near future.</p>
<p>It has been terrible! No brain zaps thank goodness, but the depression and crying spells have been everyday just about. Mood swings and irritability are heightened. I feel defensive and hurt by everything and everyone lately. On the citalopram I was normal, and I miss it: I was about to call my doctor to get back on citalopram, but decided to research first. I am so glad I did. YouTube and this forum really helped me. I am so thankful for this! I am going to remember the withdrawal effects and hopefully that will help me deal a little better.</p>
<p>Reply Link Jeff July 4, ,  My main symptom was derealization. I have been completely off of it for just over 3 weeks. The first week was really bad, brain zaps and insomnia. The dizziness is still present but has improved.</p>
<p>I still feel nauseous a lot though. Problem is that I am always dizzy and fatigued with it, making it so hard to do activities. My fatigue has been really bad lately too. I sleep a lot, but have no energy, especially after around 6. Typing this now from coming in from outside because yard toss completely drained me lol. Reply Link Susan June 30, , 5: My Psychiatrist advised me to go off Celexa to see if it was causing the tachycardia.</p>
<p>It has been 3 weeks. I have experienced increased anxiety, fatigue, brain fog, balance issues. Some of that is now subsiding.</p>
<p>But the tachycardia is non-stop right now. My question is, how long will this last? Reply Link Jenn June 28, ,  Doctor increased it to 40 mg to help with the stress I was having at grad school. She said I could start tapering my meds since I am also now out of grad school.</p>
<p>I cut my 40 to 20 the first week, then 10 then to 5, then to nothing. I have been completely off of them for about 2 weeks now. My first week off was fine. I actually had tons of energy. This all took a turn about 5 days ago as now I am battling with tinnitus and severe insomnia. I have only been able to sleep 3 total hours in the last 5 days. I have tried melatonin and sominex with no help. Doctor now wants me to go back on 10mg or go on Ambien.</p>
<p>She said my symptoms must be from anxiety and not the withdrawal. I have a huge family event in a week, help!! Would it be better for me to go back on the 10 mg.</p>
<p>Reply Link Susan June 24, ,  So good to hear others experience! I have forgotten how to sleep at night! I am also struggling with the lightheadedness. On a bonus, and a huge one â€” sex has never been better!</p>
<p>I have been on citalopram for about 16 years and can count on one hand the orgasms in that time. Since withdrawing, my sex drive has gone into overdrive and orgasms are fantastic new experience. We can get rid of these evil pills! Reply Link Debbie June 23, , 4: First 10 days felt like my head and body were not in sink, dizziness and brain zaps.</p>
<p>This eased off and I noticed no change in my mood so continued on 10mg for another 2 months and dropped to 5mg. Same symptoms as previous reduction but not as severe. Stayed on 5mg for 6 weeks then dropped to 2.</p>
<p>Am hopeful for the future without citalopram, good luck to all! Reply Link Louise June 28, , 7: I had been on 20mg Citalopram for several years due to family circumstances. I had to retire early too â€” so after 9 months of retirement decided to reduce to 10mg as I was feeling fantastic. However, after 2 weeks on 19mg I have severe migraine type headaches and am feeling sick particularly first thing in the morning. I am determined to stick with it but the headaches make it very difficult.</p>
<p>Rather than going to 5mg is it worth taking 10mg every other day, every 2 days etc. Reply Link Carly June 23, , 7: This was not to do with depression or any similar problems. The geniuses thought these pills would alleviate the pain from bowel issues!!! Pain in all parts of GI tract.</p>
<p>What a dreadful drug! How long will it take to get back to normal? Prior to that I was on 20mg of Prozac for a number of years due to major depression. I had Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for dealing with the depression caused by illness. The coping skills helped greatly allowing me to go off the Prozac.</p>
<p>I had no problem with discontinuation symptoms with Prozac. I was happy and depression free until my brother passed away. My doctor put me on Citalopram. I was feeling great again and using my coping skills so I decided to get off the Citalopram by tapering down using the 20mg to 10mg every other night.</p>
<p>I started experiencing anxiety but decided to stick it out. I have been tapering down for the past five months and with each reduction the anxiety got worse and worse. No depression, just a feeling of panic. I hope to try to get off the drug at a later date. If I had known how difficult it would be to get off this drug, I would have never taken it to begin with. If anyone has any suggestions, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>I feel this drug has poisoned my system. Reply Link Liz July 9, , 1: My suggestion is, with the approval of your doctor, taper off of it again and fight through the side effects. Reply Link Eunice June 11, , 3: Attempted to jump off after tapering to 0. So I am a year out and every bloody month there are new symptoms which come and go. The first lot was severe eczema which I already had from salicylate sensitivity.</p>
<p>I went on a low salicylate diet which managed these symptoms. And very itchy eyes when I get tired. Anyone want to tell me how long their fatigue period lasted and how they managed it? I realized that I was getting loads of side effects, and decided to get off it. My doc recommended reducing it fairly fast i. In the end it took me 3. Why am I getting terrible anxiety, and tension in my upper body? I feel really low and the tears are never far away.</p>
<p>It has been suggested to me that these things could be the result of being blown up by a bomb when I was 18 months oldâ€¦ It would really help to know whether anyone else has these symptoms so long after coming off it!? Reply Link TeresaS August 11, , 4: The first several months were terrible, and then things got a little better.</p>
<p>However, the light headedness, vertigo, and sleep issues have never waned. I also feel as though my ability to concentrate is shot, forgetfulness an issue as well; which is highly unusual because I tend to have an amazing memory. Still struggling with depression and much higher levels of anxiety.</p>
<p>I tend to wonder if the medication permanently changed something or if the initial symptoms that were muted while on the medication, are simply back, full force. Best of luck to you, and everyone else struggling with this! Reply Link Charlie June 10, , 8: It seems to be a favored drug of the VA for any type of mental issue.</p>
<p>I have tried to get support from the VA mental health on a few occasions in 3 different states but met strong resistance. So a month ago I decided to wean myself on my own. The suicidal thoughts are creeping back in. But every time that happens I look at the bands I wear in honor of my brothers who have committed suicide, it helps a lot.</p>
<p>The crying, anger, and mood swings are far worse than anything I experienced prior to being on the drug. I found this website because I was wondering if what I was going through was common or normal. But hey on the bright side I had my first erection in over 10 years! Hanging on in Oregon. Reply Link Susan July 3, ,  Also, hang in there.</p>
<p>I'v had a headache for 3 days now, very teary and basically feel crap having just stopped them. I can't understand why my doctor just stopped them straight away.</p>
<p>From what i have read on here they stop them gradually. I feel pretty good and asked my doctor if I could. I did so slowly or at least I thought so. I west from taking my 20 mg Then I took my 20 mg and skipped 2 days. Started ok and It finally hit me today really bad, Severe headache, dizziness whereby I could not walk properly, bad nausea! I called my pharmacist and she explained these were classic symptoms She also suggested I slow the weaning process down a little and stay in that stage for a longer than 2 weeks,.</p>
<p>Now I will take my 20 mg, then skip a day, 3rd day take a half pill 10 mg. I will hold this pattern for at least 3 weeks. The next step would be to go to 10 mg one day, skip one and 10 mg the third day. I had to leave work immediately.</p>
<p>Could not remember my drive home!</p></p>

I taper feel as though my ability to concentrate is shot, forgetfulness an issue as well; which is highly unusual because I tend to have an amazing memory. My doctors never even suggested quitting the citalopram. I get an overwhelming feeling of tiredness and feel the need to lie down in case I fall down. From what i have read on here they stop them gradually. I have come off them now, but the withdrawal symptoms were awful and I never want to experience them ever. I am now 71 and decided to stop because of brain fuzziness and having the opposite word come out of my mouth <i>off</i> the one I intended like, black for white.
