		<p><p>Patients were randomised to once daily Losartan 50 mg or once daily atenolol 50 mg. Other antihypertensives, with the exception of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists or beta-blockers were added if necessary to reach the goal blood pressure. The mean length of follow up was 4. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as measured by a reduction in the combined incidence of cardiovascular death, stroke and myocardial infarction.</p>
<p>Blood pressure was significantly lowered to similar levels in the two groups. Treatment with losartan resulted in a  This was mainly attributable to a reduction of the incidence of stroke. The rates of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction were not significantly different between the treatment groups. RENAAL study was a controlled clinical study conducted worldwide in Type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria, with or without hypertension.</p>
<p>The objective of the study was to demonstrate a nephroprotective effect of Losartan potassium over and above the benefit of lowering blood pressure. Patients with proteinuria and a serum creatinine of 1. Other antihypertensive agents diuretics, calcium antagonists, alpha- and beta-receptor blockers and also centrally acting antihypertensives were permitted as supplementary treatment depending on the requirement in both groups. Patients were followed up for up to 4. The primary endpoint of the study was a composite endpoint of doubling of the serum creatinine end-stage renal failure need for dialysis or transplantation or death.</p>
<p>The results showed that the treatment with Losartan events as compared with placebo events resulted in a  For the following individual and combined components of the primary endpoint, the results showed a significant risk reduction in the group treated with Losartan: All-cause mortality rate was not significantly different between the two treatment groups. In this study losartan was generally well tolerated, as shown by a therapy discontinuation rate on account of adverse reactions that was comparable to the placebo group.</p>
<p>Patients were randomised to receive losartan 50 mg once a day or losartan mg, on a background of conventional therapy excluding ACE-inhibitors. Patients were followed for over 4 years median 4. The primary endpoint of the study was a composite endpoint of all cause death or hospitalization for heart failure.</p>
<p>The results showed that treatment with mg losartan events as compared with 50 mg losartan events resulted in a  This was mainly attributable to a reduction of the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure. Treatment with mg losartan reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by  The rate of all cause death was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalaemia were more common in the mg group than in the 50 mg group, but these adverse events did not lead to significantly more treatment discontinuations in the mg group.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint of this prospective study was the all-cause mortality. The primary endpoint did not show any statistically significant difference between Losartan and captopril in reducing all-cause mortality. In both comparator-controlled not placebo-controlled clinical studies on patients with heart failure the tolerability of Losartan was superior to that of captopril, measured on the basis of a significantly lower rate of discontinuations of therapy on account of adverse reactions and a significantly lower frequency of cough.</p>
<p>The dose-response relationship became very obvious in the low dose group compared to the middle dose group period I: The lowest doses studied, 2. These results were confirmed during period II of the study where patients were randomized to continue losartan or placebo, after three weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>The difference in blood pressure increase as compared to placebo was largest in the middle dose group 6. The rise in trough diastolic blood pressure was the same in patients receiving placebo and in those continuing losartan at the lowest dose in each group, again suggesting that the lowest dose in each group did not have significant antihypertensive effect. Long-term effects of losartan on growth, puberty and general development have not been studied. The long-term efficacy of antihypertensive therapy with losartan in childhood to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has also not been established.</p>
<p>Losartan was given at doses of 0. Amlodipine was given at doses of 0. Hypertensive patients receiving losartan experienced a reduction from baseline proteinuria of  The decline in both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure was greater in the losartan group  In normotensive children a small decrease in blood pressure was observed in the losartan group  No significant correlation between the decline in proteinuria and blood pressure was noted, however it is possible that the decline in blood pressure was responsible, in part, for the decline in proteinuria in the losartan treated group.</p>
<p>Long-term effects of losartan in children with proteinuria were studied for up to 3 years in the open-label safety extension phase of the same study, in which all patients completing the week base study were invited to participate. ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p>
<p>ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. Concomitant use of sympathomimetic agents, e. Concomitant use with insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs may lead to the intensification of the blood sugar lowering effects of these drugs.</p>
<p>Symptoms of hypoglycaemia, particularly tachycardia, may be masked see section 4. Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthetase-inhibiting drugs, e. Caution must be exercised when using anaesthetic agents with Atenolol.</p>
<p>The anaesthetist should be informed and the choice of anaesthetic should be an agent with as little negative inotropic activity as possible. Use of beta-blockers with anaesthetic drugs may result in attenuation of the reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension.</p>
<p>Anaesthetic agents causing myocardial depression such as cyclopropane and trichlorethylene, lidocaine, procainamide and beta-adrenoceptor stimulants such as noradrenaline norepinephrine are best avoided. Not recommended association with monoamineoxidase inhibitors except MAO-B inhibitors Not recommended association with Baclofen: Causes an increased antihypertensive activity.</p>
<p>Not recommended association with contrast media, iodinated: Atenolol may impede the compensatory cardiovascular reactions associated with hypotension or shock induced by iodinated contrast products.</p>
<p>Combination with atenolol may result in additive depressant effects on conduction and negative inotropic effects, especially in patients with underlying sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular node dysfunction.</p>
<p>May reduce the bioavailability of atenolol. Therefore the physician should watch for evidence of altered atenolol response especially when large doses of ampicillin are administered concomitantly Peripheral muscle relaxants e. Pregnancy Atenolol crosses the placental barrier and appears in the cord blood. No studies have been performed on the use of Atenolol in the first trimester and the possibility of foetal injury cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>Atenolol has been used under close supervision for the treatment of hypertension in the third trimester. Administration of Atenolol to pregnant women in the management of mild to moderate hypertension has been associated with intra-uterine growth retardation.</p>
<p>The use of Atenolol in women who are, or may become, pregnant requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible risks, particularly in the first and second trimesters, since beta-blockers, in general, have been associated with a decrease in placental perfusion which may result in intra-uterine deaths, immature and premature deliveries. Breast-feeding There is significant accumulation of Atenolol in breast milk. Neonates born to mothers who are receiving Atenolol at parturition or breast-feeding may be at risk of hypoglycaemia and bradycardia.</p>
<p>However, it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or fatigue may occur 4. In clinical studies, the undesired events reported are usually attributable to the pharmacological actions of atenolol. The following undesired events, listed by body system, have been reported with the following frequencies: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Sleep disturbances of the type noted with other beta-blockers.</p>
<p>Mood changes, depression, anxiety, nightmares, confusion, psychoses and hallucinations. Dizziness, headache, paraesthesia of extremities. Dry eyes, impaired vision, visual disturbances.</p></p>

Hypertension studies In controlled clinical studies, once-daily administration of Losartan to patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension produced statistically significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Neither Losartan nor the active metabolite can be removed by haemodialysis. Amlodipine was given atenolol doses of 0. Anaesthetic agents causing myocardial depression such as cyclopropane and trichlorethylene, lidocaine, procainamide and beta-adrenoceptor stimulants such as noradrenaline norepinephrine are best avoided.
