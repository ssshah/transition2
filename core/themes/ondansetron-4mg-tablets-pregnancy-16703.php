		<p><p>These children were no more likely to have developmental problems than children who had not been exposed to medicines in the womb. However, the children exposed to ondansetron were not analysed separately.</p>
<p>Will my baby need extra monitoring during pregnancy? Taking ondansetron during pregnancy is not expected to cause any problems that would require extra monitoring of your baby. Are there any risks to my baby if the father has taken ondansetron?</p>
<p>We would not expect any increased risk to your baby if the father took ondansetron before or around the time you became pregnant. Who can I talk to if I have questions?</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the information in this leaflet please discuss them with your health care provider. They can access more detailed medical and scientific information from www. General information Up to 1 out of every 5 pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, and 1 in 40 babies are born with a birth defect. For prevention of PONV in paediatric patients having surgery performed under general anaesthesia, a single dose of ondansetron may be administered by slow intravenous injection not less than 30 seconds at a dose of 0.</p>
<p>For the treatment of PONV after surgery in paediatric patients having surgery performed under general anaesthesia, a single dose of Zofran may be administered by slow intravenous injection not less than 30 seconds at a dose of 0. There is limited experience in the use of Zofran in the prevention and treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting in the elderly, however Zofran is well tolerated in patients over 65 years receiving chemotherapy. Patients with Renal impairment: Patients with Hepatic impairment: Clearance of Zofran is significantly reduced and serum half life significantly prolonged in subjects with moderate or severe impairment of hepatic function.</p>
<p>Respiratory events should be treated symptomatically and clinicians should pay particular attention to them as precursors of hypersensitivity reactions. Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner see section 5. In addition, post- marketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.</p>
<p>Ondansetron should be administered with caution to patients who have or may develop prolongation of QTc, including patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation or electrolyte abnormalities.</p>
<p>Hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to ondansetron administration. Zofran can be taken with or without food, and patients can continue their normal diet while taking Zofran. Patients should limit alcohol consumption. In the case of a missed dose, patients should take Zofran as soon as possible — unless it is almost time for the next dose, in which case they should skip the missed dose. If a dose is missed and the patient feels nauseated or vomits, he or she should take the missed dose as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This is because the amount of ondansetron in your body may be increased. Other drugs that affect serotonin levels, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine. Interactions that can make ondansetron less effective Taking these drugs with ondansetron can make ondansetron less effective.</p>
<p>This is because the amount of ondansetron in your body may be decreased. Anti-seizure drugs, such as phenytoin or carbamazepine. Your doctor may switch you from ondansetron to a different drug if needed. Tuberculosis drugs, such as rifampin, rifabutin, or rifapentine. However, because drugs interact differently in each person, we cannot guarantee that this information includes all possible interactions.</p>
<p>Always speak with your healthcare provider about possible interactions with all prescription drugs, vitamins, herbs and supplements, and over-the-counter drugs that you are taking. There were an insufficient number of patients older than 75 years of age and older in the clinical trials to permit safety or efficacy conclusions in this age-group. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is needed in elderly patients. Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and the apparent volume of distribution is increased, resulting in a significant increase in the half-life of ondansetron. Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with any degree of renal impairment mild, moderate, or severe.</p>
<p>Patients should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy. In addition to the adverse reactions listed above, the following adverse reactions have been described in the setting of ondansetron overdose: Following infusion of 32 mg over only a 4-minute period, a vasovagal episode with transient second-degree heart block was observed.</p>
<p>In all instances, the adverse reactions resolved completely. Pediatric cases consistent with serotonin syndrome have been reported after inadvertent oral overdoses of ondansetron exceeding estimated ingestion of 5 mg per kg in young children.</p>
<p>Reported symptoms included somnolence , agitation, tachycardia , tachypnea , hypertension , flushing, mydriasis , diaphoresis, myoclonic movements, horizontal nystagmus , hyperreflexia, and seizure. Patients required supportive care , including intubation in some cases, with complete recovery without sequelae within 1 to 2 days. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine -receptor antagonist.</p>
<p>Serotonin receptors of the 5- HT 3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine.</p></p>
