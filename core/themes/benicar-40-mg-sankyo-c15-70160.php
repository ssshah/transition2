		<p><p>Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia , anuria, hypotension , renal failure, and death.</p>
<p>When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Benicar as soon as possible [see Use in specific Populations]. Drugs that act directly on the reninangiotensin aldosterone system RAAS can have effects on the development of immature kidneys [see Use in Specific Populations]. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.</p>
<p>Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin- angiotensin - aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Benicar.</p>
<p>In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin angiotensin - aldosterone system e. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis , increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen BUN have been reported.</p>
<p>There has been no long-term use of Benicar in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis , but similar results may be expected. Sprue-like Enteropathy Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of Benicar in cases where no other etiology is identified.</p>
<p>Drugs that inhibit the RAS can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Olmesartan medoxomil was not carcinogenic when administered by dietary administration to rats for up to 2 years. Both olmesartan medoxomil and olmesartan tested negative in the in vitro Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation assay and showed no evidence of genetic toxicity in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity test.</p>
<p>However, both were shown to induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured cells in vitro Chinese hamster lung and tested positive for thymidine kinase mutations in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin- angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death.</p>
<p>When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Benicar as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin- angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents.</p>
<p>Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the reninangiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment.</p>
<p>If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue Benicar , unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.</p>
<p>Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Benicar for hypotension , oliguria , and hyperkalemia [see Use In Specific Populations]. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to Benicar: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effects of Benicar were evaluated in one randomized, double-blind clinical study in pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age [see Clinical Studies ]. Benicar was generally well tolerated in pediatric patients, and the adverse experience profile was similar to that described for adults. The renin- angiotensin aldosterone system RAAS plays a critical role in kidney development.</p>
<p>RAAS blockade has been shown to lead to abnormal kidney development in very young mice. Administering drugs that act directly on the renin- angiotensin aldosterone system RAAS can alter normal renal development.</p>
<p>Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure. Pharmacokinetics General Olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis to olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Olmesartan appears to be eliminated in a biphasic manner with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. Olmesartan shows linear pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of up to mg and multiple oral doses of up to 80 mg.</p>
<p>Steady-state levels of olmesartan are achieved within 3 to 5 days and no accumulation in plasma occurs with once-daily dosing.</p>
<p>After oral administration, the peak plasma concentration C max of olmesartan is reached after 1 to 2 hours. Food does not affect the bioavailability of olmesartan. Metabolism and Excretion Following the rapid and complete conversion of olmesartan medoxomil to olmesartan during absorption, there is virtually no further metabolism of olmesartan. Total plasma clearance of olmesartan is 1.</p>
<p>Distribution The volume of distribution of olmesartan is approximately 17 L. The protein binding is constant at plasma olmesartan concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, olmesartan crossed the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all.</p>
<p>Olmesartan passed across the placental barrier in rats and was distributed to the fetus. Olmesartan was distributed to milk at low levels in rats. Overall, maximum plasma concentrations of olmesartan were similar in young adults and the elderly. Minor differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of olmesartan in women compared to men. In patients with renal insufficiency, serum concentrations of olmesartan were elevated compared to subjects with normal renal function.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of olmesartan in patients undergoing hemodialysis has not been studied. Pharmacodynamics Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity PRA increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.</p>
<p>The response was dose-related, as shown in the following graph. Olmesartan medoxomil doses greater than 40 mg had little additional effect. The onset of the antihypertensive effect occurred within 1 week and was largely manifest after 2 weeks. The effect was smaller in black patients usually a low-renin population , as has been seen with other ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.</p>
<p>Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature of patients who were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The use of drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure and death.</p>
<p>Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation and hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to exposure to the drug. Information for Patients Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of second and third trimester exposure to drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system and they should be told also that these consequences do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine drug exposure that has been limited to the first trimester.</p>
<p>These patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which olmesartan medoxomil was co-administered with digoxin or warfarin in healthy volunteers. Olmesartan medoxomil is not metabolized by the cytochrome P system and has no effects on P enzymes; thus, interactions with drugs that inhibit, induce or are metabolized by those enzymes are not expected.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Olmesartan medoxomil was not carcinogenic when administered by dietary administration to rats for up to 2 years.</p>
<p>Both olmesartan medoxomil and olmesartan tested negative in the in vitro Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation assay and showed no evidence of genetic toxicity in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity test.</p>
<p>However, both were shown to induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured cells in vitro Chinese hamster lung and tested positive for thymidine kinase mutations in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay. Pregnancy Pregnancy Categories C first trimester and D second and third trimesters. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats.</p>
<p>Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between elderly patients and younger patients.</p>
<p>Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Events generally were mild, transient and had no relationship to the dose of olmesartan medoxomil.</p></p>

		<p>Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. At the end of 3 weeks, patients were re-randomized to continuing Benicar or to taking placebo for up to 2 weeks.
