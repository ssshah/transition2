		<p><p>The advantages of Synthroid include the fact that it replaces the thyroid hormones in the body and increases energy. Majority of the users also report fast and consistent results, specifically in the alleviation of the symptoms. Synthroid lists down all its possible side effects but majority of the users have not reported any experiences of side effects. Lastly, it is the most recommended thyroid replacement drug by doctors. The only disadvantage is the possibility of experiencing side effects, which is usually caused by taking too much or taking too little of the medication.</p>
<p>Armour Thyroid Armour Thyroid is a type of desiccated thyroid medication that is derived from porcine thyroid glands. The tablets contain T3 or liothyronine and T4 or levothyroxine. The product provides 9 mcg of liothyronine and 38 mcg of levothyroxine for each grain of thyroid. They also tend to hear stories about others who have done well on other medications so naturally, they are curious. But is there really a "best" thyroid medication? The short answer is no.</p>
<p>Instead of asking that question it's better to ask this question: Which thyroid medication is the best for my body? This is a much better question to ask and may actually help you on your journey to feel better. The current standard of care is to use the medication Synthroid or Levothyroxine to treat all patients with low thyroid function.</p>
<p>The problem is that not all patients respond very well to this medication which creates a unique situation One in which some patients have switched to taking other medications and report dramatic results. So with this in mind let's talk about some of the other options that are available to thyroid medications such as Armour Thyroid and when you should consider switching to this medication.</p>
<p>Armour Thyroid is a thyroid medication used to treat hypothyroidism. It is unique among thyroid medications for two very distinct reasons: Is that it contains both the active thyroid hormone T3 and the inactive thyroid hormone T4. Is that it is porcine-derived. Armour Thyroid is purified desiccated thyroid gland from pigs. The way that it is processed allows for the inclusion of more thyroid hormones and hormone metabolites than any other thyroid hormone available except those also within the NDT class.</p>
<p>Armour Thyroid contains ALL of the thyroid hormones that are naturally produced in the thyroid gland of a pig. The gland is then desiccated mashed up and purified before it is put into tablet form. Patients then ingest this medication as thyroid hormone replacement therapy. So why do so many people swear by Armour Thyroid and state that it is superior to other forms of thyroid medication? Part of this reason likely has to do with the fact that Armour Thyroid contains the active thyroid hormone T3.</p>
<p>In each grain of Armour Thyroid, there is about 38mcg of T4 and about 9mcg of T3. This small amount of T3 is often enough to improve thyroid function in the entire body. Remember that T3 is much more biologically active when compared to T4 and therefore it is much stronger than T4 medications like Synthroid. But that's not all.</p>
<p>Armour Thyroid also contains other thyroid hormones such as T2 and probably other hormone precursors that we can't measure. These other hormones and precursors likely help control hypothyroid symptoms in many patients who use this medication.</p>
<p>Which is more expensive? Compared to the low-dose of Armour Thyroid, the low-dose Synthroid is nearly double the cost. It is important to note that unlike Armour Thyroid, a generic version of Synthroid is available. Upon comparison, it appears that there are 12 total dosing options for Synthroid and only 8 dosing options for Armour Thyroid.</p>
<p>Armour Thyroid is manufactured in tablets of: Synthroid is manufactured in tablets of: Since it is often difficult to calibrate optimal dosages for the treatment of hypothyroidism, the greater the number of total dosing options, the more precise doctors can be with their prescriptions.</p>
<p>Slight alterations in dosing are more convenient with Synthroid e. From the perspective of available manufactured dosages, Synthroid should be considered slightly advantageous. That said, most patients can learn to use a pill cutter to optimally calibrate Armour Thyroid dosages. Which is more effective? When comparing thyroid replacement therapies of Armour Thyroid and Synthroid, it is necessary to consider whether one intervention may be more effective than the other.</p>
<p>Synthroid has undergone extensive clinical testing for the treatment of hypothyroidism and has been considered clinically effective since by the FDA. To attain FDA approval, Synthroid had to demonstrate significant therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of hypothyroidism compared to a placebo in randomized controlled trials RCTs. Unlike Synthroid, formulations of Armour Thyroid desiccated thyroid extract have not been formally evaluated by the FDA.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of clinical testing, the efficacy of Armour Thyroid as a treatment for hypothyroidism should be questionable. Despite the lack of randomized controlled trials to elucidate the clinical efficacy of Armour Thyroid, it has been a part of head-to-head comparative research with Synthroid.</p>
<p>There is some evidence to suggest that Armour Thyroid is equally as effective as Synthroid for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Most medical professionals acknowledge that each intervention is capable of optimizing TSH, T4, and T3 concentrations. Armour Thyroid is formulated as a natural blend of T4 thyroxine and T3 triiodothyronine.</p>
<p>Synthroid is a synthetic version of T4 thyroxine known as levothyroxine, and unlike Armour Thyroid, it does not directly increase T3. Ingestion of Synthroid mimics the endogenous effects of T4, which gets converted to T3. There is some evidence to support the idea that Armour Thyroid may elevate T3 triiodothyronine to a supraphysiologic extent due to the fact that it is manufactured at a 4: That said, Armour Thyroid and Synthroid are thought to elicit similar effects, thereby reversing neurophysiological abnormalities associated with hypothyroidism.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of each thyroid replacement is thought to improve: DNA transcription, protein synthesis, basal metabolic rate, tissue oxygenation, and lipolysis. Many companies attempted to create treatments using thyroid glands in response to the new market. A lot of these companies failed. However, the most well-known and effective of these was Armour and Company, the largest American meatpacker and owner of slaughterhouses in the s.</p>
<p>Since Armour and Company had access to all the offal, or organs, of the animals through their already established business, they were able to dominate the thyroid treatment industry easily. The Armour brand later split up, but the name still stuck to the thyroid treatment we know today. Use Today Although not as popular as levothyroxine, Armour Thyroid, and similar drugs such as Westhroid and Nature-Throid, are still used today.</p>
<p>Others like it because it contains a combination of T4 and T3 hormones. Most doctors, however, tend to avoid Armour Thyroid and similar thyroid extracts. Most do not like that there seems to be a high level of variation in hormones.</p>
<p>For example, even though the tablet will state 60 mg of desiccated thyroid, the actual thyroid hormones can be anywhere from 20 mcg to 50 mcg. Regardless of the reasons, Armour Thyroid was dropped from most medical curriculums about 50 years ago.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon today for doctors to have not heard of desiccated thyroids being used to treat hypothyroidism. It is certainly an old medicine.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that it is outdated. Some patients who have tried both treatments, religiously prefer Armour Thyroid. However, it is still prudent to know about the unintended consequences of using Armour Thyroid. The most common side effect of Armour Thyroid is hair loss. For most, this is temporary and occurs only during the first three months when your body is still adjusting to the treatment.</p>
<p>However, some patients have experienced continued hair loss after this period. The rarer side effects are: Forest Laboratories recommends you stop using Armour Thyroid and see a doctor immediately if you experience allergic reactions such as severe dizziness, trouble breathing, or chest pains when taking Armour Thyroid. These two side effects that are very, very rare but are life threatening. Studies have also shown Armour Thyroid interacts with birth control pills, blood thinners, insulin, and thioamides, decreasing the effectiveness of all these drugs.</p>
<p>Make sure your doctor knows all the other drugs you might be taking before using Armour Thyroid and similar drugs. The reason for this is that it is easy to overdose on this drug. It is quite dangerous as well.</p>
<p>If you take more Armour Thyroid than your doctor recommends, you will end up having too much thyroid hormones, a condition known as hyperthyroidism.</p></p>

Armour Thyroid is manufactured in tablets of: Each thyroid replacement therapy tends to provoke side effects such as: Like any intervention, certain individuals may experience less side effects with Armour Thyroid than Synthroid and vice-versa. The gland is then desiccated mashed up and armoured before it is put into tablet synthroid. It is not uncommon synthroid for doctors to have not heard of desiccated withs being used to treat hypothyroidism, synthroid with armour. Basically, both treatments work armour and have been proven to with the hormones in the body. It is possible that slight nuances in respective withs of action could facilitate superior efficacy with one thyroid replacement with the other [in a subset of users]. Another potential issue with Synthroid is that it often contains many inactive fillers and dyes. Popularity Data suggests that over 20 million prescriptions are filled for Synthroid annually. Patients who took the thyroid extract lost around 4 pounds without changing their diet or armour routine and also reported a reduction in their subjective symptoms such as higher energy levels in a questionnaire. Although the effect was not immediate, the symptoms of Myxedema soon began to disappear in the patient. Studies have also shown Armour Thyroid interacts with birth control pills, blood thinners, insulin, and thioamides, decreasing the effectiveness of all these drugs. <a href="http://transition2.techinest.com/core/themes/puis-je-acheter-viagra-sans-ordonnance-45215.php">Puis je acheter viagra sans ordonnance</a> with a medical professional to trial both Armour Thyroid and Synthroid to find what works best for armour. Another disadvantage is that it comes from porcine thyroid glands, <b>synthroid with armour</b>, which means that it is not compatible for patients who have pork allergy or are not allowed synthroid eat with because of religious restrictions. Some patients who armour tried both treatments, synthroid with armour, religiously prefer Armour Thyroid, synthroid with armour. They ask because often times they aren't feeling well on their current medication and they believe that switching medications may be the answer.</p><br clear="left" />

Also keep in mind that the thyroid replacement therapy that is ideal for your neurophysiology may be a poor fit for someone else; you may like Armour Thyroid, but another person may be unable to tolerate it. While Synthroid only replaces the T4 hormone, the body easily converts T4 to T3 hormone, providing the body with a good supply of thyroid hormones to restore balance. The problem is that not all patients armour very well to this medication which creates a unique situation Armour Thyroid contains two thyroid hormones, thyroxine T4 and triiodothyronine T3that are extracted from <i>synthroid</i> thyroid glands of pigs.
