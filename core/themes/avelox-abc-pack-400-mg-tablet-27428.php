		<p><p>In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended see section 4. Prevention of photosensitivity reactions Quinolones have been shown to cause photosensitivity reactions in patients. However, studies have shown that moxifloxacin has a lower risk to induce photosensitivity.</p>
<p>Patients with glucosephosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Patients with a family history of, or actual glucosephosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are prone to haemolytic reactions when treated with quinolones. Therefore, moxifloxacin should be used with caution in these patients. Patients with galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.</p>
<p>Patients with pelvic inflammatory disease For patients with complicated pelvic inflammatory disease e. Pelvic inflammatory disease may be caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Therefore in such cases empirical moxifloxacin should be co-administered with another appropriate antibiotic e. If clinical improvement is not achieved after 3 days of treatment, the therapy should be reconsidered.</p>
<p>Patients with special cSSSi Clinical efficacy of intravenous moxifloxacin in the treatment of severe burn infections, fasciitis and diabetic foot infections with osteomyelitis has not been established. Interference with biological tests Moxifloxacin therapy may interfere with the Mycobacterium spp. In case of a suspected or confirmed infection due to MRSA, treatment with an appropriate antibacterial agent should be started see section 5. Paediatric population Due to adverse effects on the cartilage in juvenile animals see section 5.</p>
<p>This might lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. Therefore, co-administration of moxifloxacin with any of the following medicinal products is contraindicated see also section 4. Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients who are taking medication that can reduce potassium levels e.</p>
<p>An interval of about 6 hours should be left between administration of agents containing bivalent or trivalent cations e. Therefore, the concomitant use of these two drugs is not recommended except for overdose cases, see also section 4. No precaution is required for use with digoxin. The combination of glibenclamide and moxifloxacin could theoretically result in a mild and transient hyperglycaemia. However, the observed pharmacokinetic changes for glibenclamide did not result in changes of the pharmacodynamic parameters blood glucose, insulin.</p>
<p>Therefore no clinically relevant interaction was observed between moxifloxacin and glibenclamide. Changes in INR A large number of cases showing an increase in oral anticoagulant activity have been reported in patients receiving antibacterial agents, especially fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, cotrimoxazole and some cephalosporins.</p>
<p>The infectious and inflammatory conditions, age and general status of the patient appear to be risk factors. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to evaluate whether the infection or the treatment caused the INR international normalised ratio disorder. A precautionary measure would be to more frequently monitor the INR. Tell your doctor right away about the reaction and the use of this product. To help prevent low blood sugar , eat meals on a regular schedule, and do not skip meals.</p>
<p>Your doctor may need to switch you to another antibiotic or adjust your diabetes medications if any reaction occurs. This drug may make you dizzy. Alcohol or marijuana can make you more dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Talk to your doctor if you are using marijuana. This medication may make you more sensitive to the sun. Limit your time in the sun. Avoid tanning booths and sunlamps.</p>
<p>Convulsions have been reported in patients receiving quinolones. Quinolones may also cause central nervous system CNS events including: These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with all quinolones, moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders e. Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including moxifloxacin.</p>
<p>Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. Moxifloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Oxygen, intravenous steroids, and airway management, including intubation, may be administered as indicated. Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including AVELOX. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AVELOX, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.</p></p>

The risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in elderly patients and in those treated concurrently with corticosteroids.
