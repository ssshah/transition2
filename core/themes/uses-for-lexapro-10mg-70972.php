		<p><p>The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using escitalopram, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. Talk to your doctor about using escitalopram safely. This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy. With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week.</p>
<p>At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram oxalate are bioequivalent. Absorption and Distribution Following a single oral dose 20 mg tablet or solution of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours.</p>
<p>Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable. In humans, unchanged escitalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentration of the escitalopram metabolite S-DCT in plasma is approximately one-third that of escitalopram. In vitro studies show that escitalopram is at least 7 and 27 times more potent than S-DCT and S-DDCT, respectively, in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites of escitalopram do not contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of escitalopram.</p>
<p>No adjustment of dosage is needed in adolescent patients. Gender - Based on data from single- and multiple-dose studies measuring escitalopram in elderly, young adults, and adolescents, no dosage adjustment on the basis of gender is needed.</p>
<p>No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. Based on in vitro data, escitalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. While in vivo data to address this question are limited, results from drug interaction studies suggest that escitalopram, at a dose of 20 mg, has no 3A4 inhibitory effect and a modest 2D6 inhibitory effect.</p>
<p>See Drug Interactions 7. A no-effect dose for this finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Racemic citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay Ames test in 2 of 5 bacterial strains Salmonella TA98 and TA in the absence of metabolic activation.</p>
<p>It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.</p>
<p>Additional studies to investigate the mechanism for this pathology have not been performed, and the potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established. A subsequent intravenous dosing study demonstrated that in beagle dogs, racemic DDCT caused QT prolongation, a known risk factor for the observed outcome in dogs.</p>
<p>In this outpatient study in children and adolescents 7 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, citalopram treatment showed statistically significant greater mean improvement from baseline, compared to placebo, on the CDRS-R; the positive results for this trial largely came from the adolescent subgroup.</p>
<p>Two additional flexible-dose, placebo-controlled MDD studies one Lexapro study in patients ages 7 to 17 and one citalopram study in adolescents did not demonstrate efficacy.</p>
<p>Although maintenance efficacy in adolescent patients has not been systematically evaluated, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of escitalopram pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and adolescent patients. Adults The efficacy of Lexapro as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>The 10 mg and 20 mg Lexapro groups were similar on this outcome measure. Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.</p>
<p>Patients receiving continued Lexapro experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse compared to those receiving placebo.</p>
<p>There were too few patients in differing ethnic and age groups to adequately assess whether or not Lexapro has differential effects in these groups. There was no difference in response to Lexapro between men and women. Imprint "FL" on one side of the tablet and "5" on the other side. Imprint on scored side with "F" on the left side and "L" on the right side. Do not use Lexapro within 14 days before or 14 days after you have used a MAO inhibitor , such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine.</p>
<p>Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor. Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as: Do not give Lexapro to anyone under 12 years. Before taking this medicine You should not use Lexapro if you are allergic to escitalopram or citalopram Celexa , or if: Do not use Lexapro within 14 days before or 14 days after you have used an MAO inhibitor.</p>
<p>I'm still experiencing anorgasmia but it's a trade off I can accept. I feel calm, cool and collected. I'm making phone calls and small talk. This is the most I've ever felt like a "regular human". I had a panic attack everyday and they would last hours. Around two and a half years ago the symptoms just became unbearable I wasn't functioning well at work or socially When cognitive behavioral therapy didn't really resolve things my doctor started me on 10mg of Lexapro.</p>
<p>After the initial adjustment period it did take the edge off of the Depression symptoms quite a bit, however, the Anxiety still prevailed so after 3 months my physician increased my dose to 20mg which I feel effectively makes the symptoms very manageable. This medication helps me be a high functioning individual despite my diagnosis.</p>
<p>A couple words of caution; One: Do not just stop taking Lex without dosing down. Need For Comprehensive Treatment Program Lexapro is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for MDD that may include other measures psychological, educational, social for patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all adolescents with this syndrome. Safety and effectiveness of Lexapro in MDD has not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.</p>
<p>Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. A no-effect dose for this finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis Racemic citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay Ames test in 2 of 5 bacterial strains Salmonella TA98 and TA in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.</p>
<p>Slight maternal toxicity clinical signs and decreased body weight gain and food consumption was seen at this dose. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity clinical signs, decreased body weight gain. Thus, teratogenic effects of racemic citalopram were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with racemic citalopram 4.</p>
<p>The no-effect dose was  A no-effect dose was not determined in that study. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, escitalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Pregnancy-Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to Lexapro and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRIs , late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery.</p>
<p>Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis , apnea , seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia , hypotonia , hypertonia , hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. PPHN occurs in 1 - 2 per 1, live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.</p></p>
