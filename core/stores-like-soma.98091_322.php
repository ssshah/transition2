Numerous <i>stores</i> were heard as you stepped into the kitchen to wash all the dirty dishes, <b>stores like soma</b>.</p>
<p>Soma's father was also there to assist you. Sighing, you thought that it was like to let him be. He would usually recover after few minutes or so. At the corner of your eyes, you saw Mayumi approaching Soma, trying to cheer the red haired male. I've <b>like</b> had such delicious Chinese fried rice!
